New
support
is
needed
for
vital
multi-disciplinary
internet
research
projects
following
the
drought
...
[+]
cased
by
Covid-19.
getty
Since
1985,
the
Domain
Name
System
(DNS)
has
played
a
critical
but
underappreciated
role
to
map
names
to
internet
addresses.&nbsp;Domain
names
have
important
value
as
intellectual
property
and
marketing
assets
in
addition
to
their
ability
to
“route
the
money
of
the
Internet.”
The
market
value
of
global
DNS
ecosystem
is
roughly
$8
billion
annually,
with
additional
value
for
domain
names.
This
finding
comes
from
an
important
new
paper
Changing
Markets
for
Domain
Names:
Technical,
Economic,
and
Policy
Challenges
presented
at
the
48
th
Telecom
Policy
Research
Conference
(TPRC48)
by
William
Lehr,
David
Clark
and
Steve
Bauer.
The
paper
represents
another
research
milestone
from
MIT
Computer
Science
&amp;
Artificial
Intelligence
Lab
whose
scholars
explore
fundamental
scientific
questions
of
the
internet.
Clark
is
one
of
the
early
internet
pioneers
who
later
served
as
its
Chief
Protocol
Architect
1981-1989.
In
the
last
10
years,
the
number
of
generic
Top
Level
Domains
(TLDs)
has
expanded
significantly
from
a
handful
of
suffixes
.com
for
commercial,
.org
for
organization,
.edu
for
education,
.gov
for
US
government,
and
.mil
for
US
military
to
nearly
1200,
which,
including
country
code
TLDs
(.EU
etc)
numbers
about
1500.
This
evolution
has
given
firms
more
flexibility
beyond
.com
to
register
their
online
business
addresses
and
may
even
offer
additional
marketing
value
with
suffixes
like
.baby,
.cafe,
and
so
on.
The
DNS
is
managed
under
multi-stakeholder
global
internet
governance
coordinated
by
Internet
Corporation
for
Assigned
Names
and
Numbers
(ICANN)
and
sets
the
rules
for
the
generic
TLD
registries
like
Verisign
(.com,
.net)
and
the
Public
Interest
Registry
(.org),
which
supply
at
wholesale
second
level
domain
names
to
registrars
like
GoDaddy
and
Alibaba
which
are
then
registered
for
a
fee
by
registrants
like
Forbes
(i.e.,
Forbes.com).
The
primary
registration
of
domain
names,
350
million
and
growing,
drives
roughly
$8
billon
in
annual
revenue.
The
secondary
or
resale
market
is
$2
billion
with
the
purchase
and
renewal
of
.com
domain
names.
&nbsp;Calculating
the
market
value
of
DNS
is
admittedly
difficult
because
DNS
activities
are
calculated
within
other
business
activities
of
major
online,
firms,
the
decentralized
ecosystem
of
the
internet
itself,
and
lack
of
transparency
of
domain
actors
in
China
and
other
countries.
The
importance
and
relevance
of
DNS
The
authors
observe
that
the
intellectual
property
associated
with
domain
names
and
the
value
of
DNS
itself
as
embedded,
reliable
infrastructure.
However,
changing
behavior
is
reducing
the
value
and
function
of
DNS
by
separating
names
from
addresses.
Search
engines,
content
delivery
networks,
and
digital
object
identifiers
obviate
the
user’s
need
to
access
DNS.
As
users
spend
more
time
on
mobile
apps,
the
DNS
might
not
be
used
at
all.
<fbs-ad
position="inread"
progressive=""
ad-id="article-0-inread"
aria-hidden="true"
role="presentation">
Another
issue
is
the
protocol
of
encrypted
DNS
called
DNS
Over
HTTPS
or
DOH
which
relocates
that
DNS
resolution
to
a
new
part
of
the
internet
and
brings
increased
control
of
the
Internet
under
these
already
large
entities
like
Google
and
Mozilla
.
Normally,
DNS
is
a
separate
service
from
the
platform,
but
encrypted
DNS
demonstrates
how
platforms
can
also
exert
control
on
points
outside
their
network.
This
also
bedevils
law
enforcement
which
is
unable
to
locate
registrants
when
traffic
is
encrypted.

Policy
questions
in
DNS
governance
The
paper
explores
complex
questions
of
market
power,
governance,
regulatory
oversight,
and
ecosystem
fragmentation.
Few
consumers
realize
it,
but
price
controls
have
been
in
place
to
enable
easy
and
low-cost
switching
from
registry
to
another
(from
.com
to
.org
for
example),
similar
to
number
portability.
However
companies
like
GoDaddy
and
Network
Solutions
are
not
price
regulated
and
can
easily
raise
prices
for
domain
names
without
losing
customers.
If
a
business
must
have
a
certain
domain
name,
they
will
likely
purchase
it
and/or
renew
it
whether
the
price
is
$10
or
$100.
There
is
a
secondary
market
of
existing
domain
names
in
which
speculators
or
“domainers”
who
purchase
desirable
domain
names
with
the
hope
of
“flipping”
them
for
a
higher
price.
The
paper
cites
a
first-of
-its
kind
study
of
the
secondary
market
by
the
Boston
Consulting
Group
which
estimates
that
18%
of
.com
domain
names
are
currently
registered
exclusively
for
resale
by
domainers
with
the
average
price
of
$1660
in
2020.
These
domain
names
are
withheld
from
availability
to
the
general
public
prices
and
therefore
from
productive
use.
&nbsp;Moreover,
domain
name
buyers
in
this
market
experience
not
just
price
shocks
(BCG
estimates
that
the
prices
are
150
to
200
times
the
customary
registrar
prices),
but
potential
abuse
of
brand,
copyright,
trademark,
and
keywords.
The
MIT
authors
suggest
that
this
is
not
necessarily
added
value
in
the
economy.
The
lack
of
transparency
in
the
secondary
market
is
additionally
problematic
in
that
governance
actors
can’t
necessarily
anticipate
or
monitor
abuse.
&nbsp;
Technically-informed
policy
and
policy-informed
technology
The
paper
is
part
of
a
larger
$1
million
Convergence
Accelerator
project
by
the
National
Science
Foundation
to
improve
internet
security
by
studying
its
structural
dependencies,
ownership,
and
economic
interrelationships.
Funding
for
these
vital
multi-disciplinary
research
projects
has
all
but
dried
up
in
the
wake
of
Covid-19.
Federal
agencies
and
corporations
have
tightened
research
budgets.
Funding
is
necessary
to
support
quality
academic
research
into
the
public
domain
and
to
raise
the
quality
of
policy
debate.
Understanding
DNS
and
other
internet
phenomena
has
never
been
more
important.
&nbsp;People
increasingly
rely
on
the
internet
for
to
work,
learn,
shop,
communicate,
and
get
healthcare.
An
important
interdisciplinary
internet
policy
conference
now
in
its
49
th
year,
TPRC49
,
is
one
forum
for
this
and
related
academic
papers.
Abstracts
for
papers,
posters,
and
panels
for
the
September
conference
are
due
March
31.
