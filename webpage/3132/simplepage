The Covid-19 pandemic has fundamentally reshaped the hospitality industry—and building customer confidence in cleaning protocol is key to how businesses move forward. Even with the vaccinations beginning to take place across the U.S., 95% of consumers want to see as much or more cleaning and sanitation practices after the vaccine is widely distributed. 1 “It is clear that consumers will continue looking for reassurance that the places where they eat, stay, work and shop are clean and safe,” says Tim Mulhere, executive vice president and president of Ecolab’s Global Institutional business. To meet these heightened consumer expectations, Ecolab—which provides hygiene, public health and infection prevention solutions for a range of industries—developed the Ecolab Science Certified program . Informed by scientists and industry experts, the program combines enhanced cleaning measures with detailed workplace training and auditing. For a closer look, explore a Q&amp;A that highlights how the program is helping the restaurant and hotel industries navigate public health and food safety concerns presented by the Covid-19 pandemic and beyond. <fbs-ad position="top" progressive ad-id="article-0-top"> <fbs-embedly style="padding-bottom: 76.39%;" iframe-src="https://embedly.forbes.com/widgets/media.html?src=%2F%2Fview.ceros.com%2Fforbes%2Frestaurant-desktop%3FheightOverride%3D1100&amp;display_name=Ceros&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fview.ceros.com%2Fforbes%2Frestaurant-desktop&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia-s3-us-east-1.ceros.com%2Fforbes%2Fpage-thumbnails%2F2021%2F01%2F29%2F36e704b709c5c6157cb7480ce8c9dec9%2Fpage-thumbnail.jpg%3FimageOpt%3D1%26crop%3D870%2C556%2Cx0%2Cy0&amp;key=3ce26dc7e3454db5820ba084d28b4935&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=ceros"> How does the program help restaurants deliver a higher level of cleanliness? The use of hospital disinfectants and other sanitizers can help kill the virus on surfaces—but in a restaurant environment it’s also essential that these products are safe for use around food. Ecolab’s new Sink &amp; Surface Cleaner Sanitizer kills the Covid-19 virus in just 15 seconds, which is the fastest product proven to kill the virus. 2 The no-rinse formula can be safely used on food contact surfaces such as tables, counters, food-prep areas and sinks. Ecolab also offers one of the broadest product portfolios proven to kill the Covid-19 virus, including hospital disinfectants and food-contact sanitizers.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ecolab’s Sink &amp; Surface Cleaner Sanitizer is hospital grade and kills the Covid-19 virus in just 15 seconds. How has the program updated cleaning protocols? While using the right products is crucial, all solutions are less effective if used incorrectly. Ecolab public health and food safety experts, informed by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines, have created a set of protocols and best practices for restaurant staff to help improve food safety and reduce exposure to germs. Thorough training procedures outline when, where and how to clean. The protocols address increased frequency and duration of cleaning—especially in high-touch areas—and visible cleaning by employees. Does the program validate that restaurants are adhering to protocols? Restaurant customers can feel more confident knowing cleaning and disinfecting practices and public health guidelines are subject to an on-site independent validation performed by an Ecolab public health and food safety specialist. These assessments verify that cleaning products are being used correctly and public health guidelines are being followed, while providing additional support and training to resolve any gaps. <fbs-embedly style="padding-bottom: 69.44%;" iframe-src="https://embedly.forbes.com/widgets/media.html?src=%2F%2Fview.ceros.com%2Fforbes%2Fhotels-desktop-2-2&amp;display_name=Ceros&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fview.ceros.com%2Fforbes%2Fhotels-desktop-2-2&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia-s3-us-east-1.ceros.com%2Fforbes%2Fpage-thumbnails%2F2021%2F02%2F01%2F1764bb121195d047d14642f60b458108%2Fpage-thumbnail.jpg%3FimageOpt%3D1%26crop%3D870%2C604%2Cx0%2Cy0&amp;key=3ce26dc7e3454db5820ba084d28b4935&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=ceros"> How does the program help hotels deliver a higher level of cleanliness? In addition to hospital disinfectants and other sanitizers, hotel staff use Ecolab solutions such as dispensers with precision-dosing that allow for consistent distribution of the products, helping eliminate guesswork. The program also includes hotel-specific training modules to instruct staff on best cleaning practices, including how to disinfect high-touch surfaces (such as remote controls, doorknobs and light switches) and how long to leave a product on a surface. These cleaning guidelines extend throughout the hotel property—including the front desk, elevators, bar and restaurant, gym and public bathrooms. Staff undergo hotel-specific training in Covid-19 basics and guest service etiquette What training does hotel staff receive as part of the program? Ecolab training specialists have designed an interactive curriculum for employees with courses focusing on essential public health protocols and the proper use of personal protective equipment, including masks and gloves. The new service etiquette module offers scenario-based training, based on anticipated interactions between staff and guests, as well as suggested responses. What does the Ecolab Science Certified seal on a hotel or other business mean? Hotels and other businesses that meet the stringent requirements of the Ecolab Science Certified program receive the seal, which indicates the program criteria have been met—including the use of correct products and protocols, food safety and pest solutions, employee training and auditing and compliance verification. This seal is a visible commitment to advancing cleaner, safer practices and helps guests feel more confident the establishment has invested in science-based solutions that help deliver a higher level of cleanliness.
