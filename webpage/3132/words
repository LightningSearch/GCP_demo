The
Covid-19
pandemic
has
fundamentally
reshaped
the
hospitality
industry—and
building
customer
confidence
in
cleaning
protocol
is
key
to
how
businesses
move
forward.
Even
with
the
vaccinations
beginning
to
take
place
across
the
U.S.,
95%
of
consumers
want
to
see
as
much
or
more
cleaning
and
sanitation
practices
after
the
vaccine
is
widely
distributed.
1
“It
is
clear
that
consumers
will
continue
looking
for
reassurance
that
the
places
where
they
eat,
stay,
work
and
shop
are
clean
and
safe,”
says
Tim
Mulhere,
executive
vice
president
and
president
of
Ecolab’s
Global
Institutional
business.
To
meet
these
heightened
consumer
expectations,
Ecolab—which
provides
hygiene,
public
health
and
infection
prevention
solutions
for
a
range
of
industries—developed
the
Ecolab
Science
Certified
program
.
Informed
by
scientists
and
industry
experts,
the
program
combines
enhanced
cleaning
measures
with
detailed
workplace
training
and
auditing.
For
a
closer
look,
explore
a
Q&amp;A
that
highlights
how
the
program
is
helping
the
restaurant
and
hotel
industries
navigate
public
health
and
food
safety
concerns
presented
by
the
Covid-19
pandemic
and
beyond.

How
does
the
program
help
restaurants
deliver
a
higher
level
of
cleanliness?
The
use
of
hospital
disinfectants
and
other
sanitizers
can
help
kill
the
virus
on
surfaces—but
in
a
restaurant
environment
it’s
also
essential
that
these
products
are
safe
for
use
around
food.
Ecolab’s
new
Sink
&amp;
Surface
Cleaner
Sanitizer
kills
the
Covid-19
virus
in
just
15
seconds,
which
is
the
fastest
product
proven
to
kill
the
virus.
2
The
no-rinse
formula
can
be
safely
used
on
food
contact
surfaces
such
as
tables,
counters,
food-prep
areas
and
sinks.
Ecolab
also
offers
one
of
the
broadest
product
portfolios
proven
to
kill
the
Covid-19
virus,
including
hospital
disinfectants
and
food-contact
sanitizers.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ecolab’s
Sink
&amp;
Surface
Cleaner
Sanitizer
is
hospital
grade
and
kills
the
Covid-19
virus
in
just
15
seconds.
How
has
the
program
updated
cleaning
protocols?
While
using
the
right
products
is
crucial,
all
solutions
are
less
effective
if
used
incorrectly.
Ecolab
public
health
and
food
safety
experts,
informed
by
Centers
for
Disease
Control
and
Prevention
guidelines,
have
created
a
set
of
protocols
and
best
practices
for
restaurant
staff
to
help
improve
food
safety
and
reduce
exposure
to
germs.
Thorough
training
procedures
outline
when,
where
and
how
to
clean.
The
protocols
address
increased
frequency
and
duration
of
cleaning—especially
in
high-touch
areas—and
visible
cleaning
by
employees.
Does
the
program
validate
that
restaurants
are
adhering
to
protocols?
Restaurant
customers
can
feel
more
confident
knowing
cleaning
and
disinfecting
practices
and
public
health
guidelines
are
subject
to
an
on-site
independent
validation
performed
by
an
Ecolab
public
health
and
food
safety
specialist.
These
assessments
verify
that
cleaning
products
are
being
used
correctly
and
public
health
guidelines
are
being
followed,
while
providing
additional
support
and
training
to
resolve
any
gaps.

How
does
the
program
help
hotels
deliver
a
higher
level
of
cleanliness?
In
addition
to
hospital
disinfectants
and
other
sanitizers,
hotel
staff
use
Ecolab
solutions
such
as
dispensers
with
precision-dosing
that
allow
for
consistent
distribution
of
the
products,
helping
eliminate
guesswork.
The
program
also
includes
hotel-specific
training
modules
to
instruct
staff
on
best
cleaning
practices,
including
how
to
disinfect
high-touch
surfaces
(such
as
remote
controls,
doorknobs
and
light
switches)
and
how
long
to
leave
a
product
on
a
surface.
These
cleaning
guidelines
extend
throughout
the
hotel
property—including
the
front
desk,
elevators,
bar
and
restaurant,
gym
and
public
bathrooms.
Staff
undergo
hotel-specific
training
in
Covid-19
basics
and
guest
service
etiquette
What
training
does
hotel
staff
receive
as
part
of
the
program?
Ecolab
training
specialists
have
designed
an
interactive
curriculum
for
employees
with
courses
focusing
on
essential
public
health
protocols
and
the
proper
use
of
personal
protective
equipment,
including
masks
and
gloves.
The
new
service
etiquette
module
offers
scenario-based
training,
based
on
anticipated
interactions
between
staff
and
guests,
as
well
as
suggested
responses.
What
does
the
Ecolab
Science
Certified
seal
on
a
hotel
or
other
business
mean?
Hotels
and
other
businesses
that
meet
the
stringent
requirements
of
the
Ecolab
Science
Certified
program
receive
the
seal,
which
indicates
the
program
criteria
have
been
met—including
the
use
of
correct
products
and
protocols,
food
safety
and
pest
solutions,
employee
training
and
auditing
and
compliance
verification.
This
seal
is
a
visible
commitment
to
advancing
cleaner,
safer
practices
and
helps
guests
feel
more
confident
the
establishment
has
invested
in
science-based
solutions
that
help
deliver
a
higher
level
of
cleanliness.
