Now
more
than
ever,
leading
financial
institutions
depend
on
technology
to
mine
valuable
data
from
a
multitude
of
complex
sources
to
enrich
and
connect
it
across
topical
lines
so
key
stakeholders
can
obtain
relevant
information.
This
can
provide
tremendous
opportunities
to
increase
revenue
and
reduce
risk.
Yet,
at
the
same
time,
organizations
are
required
to
comply
with even
more
stringent
regulations.
These
regulations,
such
as Dodd
Frank (US),
MiFID
II
(EU),
the
GDPR
(EU)
and
the
proposed
California
Consumer
Privacy
Act,
are
examples
of
major
regulatory
changes
that heighten
the
pressure
on
your
organization
to
organize
and
secure
data,
as
well
as
make
it
readily
accessible
no
matter
where
it
is
stored
and
in
what
applications.
Becoming
information-driven
can
help
your
organization
enhance
the
performance
of
key
stakeholders
in
significant
ways,
such
as:
Leveraging
technology
to
surface
actionable
information
across
all
business
functions.
Finding
patterns
and
relationships
among
disparate
data
from
different
silos
to
deliver
an
advanced
Know
Your
Customer
(KYC)
approach
with
contextual
insights
from
a
timeline
of
important
events
including
M&amp;A
activity,
fundraising,
credits,
litigation,
etc.
Surfacing
topically
relevant
information
from
disparate
sources
in
a
unified
view
–
for
example,
a
360°
view
of
a
bond
fund
that
brings
together
information
from
different
business
applications,
previous
analysis,
broker
commentary,
email,
new
sites,
etc.
