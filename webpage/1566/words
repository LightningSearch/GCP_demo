Perhaps
you’ve
wondered
how
Facebook
or
Instagram
is
able
to
automatically
recognize
faces
in
an
image,
or
how
Google
lets
you
search
the
web
for
similar
photos
just
by
uploading
a
photo
of
your
own.
These
features
are
examples
of
computer
vision
,
and
they
are
powered
by
convolutional
neural
networks
(CNNs)
.
Yet
what
exactly
are
convolutional
neural
networks?
Let’s
take
a
deep
dive
into
the
architecture
of
a
CNN
and
understand
how
they
operate.
What
are
Neural
Networks?
Before
we
begin
talking
about
convolutional
neural
networks,
let’s
take
a
moment
to
define
regular
neural
network.
There’s
another
article
on
the
topic
of
neural
networks
available,
so
we
won’t
go
too
deep
into
them
here.
However,
to
briefly
define
them
they
are
computational
models
inspired
by
the
human
brain.
A
neural
network
operates
by
taking
in
data
and
manipulating
the
data
by
adjusting
“weights”,
which
are
assumptions
about
how
the
input
features
are
related
to
each
other
and
the
object’s
class.
As
the
network
is
trained
the
values
of
the
weights
are
adjusted
and
they
will
hopefully
converge
on
weights
that
accurately
capture
the
relationships
between
features.
This
is
how
a
feed-forward
neural
network
operates,
and
CNNs
are
comprised
of
two
halves:
a
feed-forward
neural
network
and
a
group
of
convolutional
layers.
What
are
Convolution
Neural
Networks
(CNNs)?
What
are
the
“convolutions”
that
happen
in
a
convolutional
neural
network?
A
convolution
is
a
mathematical
operation
that
creates
a
set
of
weights,
essentially
creating
a
representation
of
parts
of
the
image.
This
set
of
weights
is
referred
to
as
a
kernel
or
filter
.
The
filter
that
is
created
is
smaller
than
the
entire
input
image,
covering
just
a
subsection
of
the
image.
The
values
in
the
filter
are
multiplied
with
the
values
in
the
image.
The
filter
is
then
moved
over
to
form
a
representation
of
a
new
part
of
the
image,
and
the
process
is
repeated
until
the
entire
image
has
been
covered.
Another
way
to
think
about
this
is
to
imagine
a
brick
wall,
with
the
bricks
representing
the
pixels
in
the
input
image.
A
“window”
is
being
slid
back
and
forth
along
the
wall,
which
is
the
filter.
The
bricks
that
are
viewable
through
the
window
are
the
pixels
having
their
value
multiplied
by
the
values
within
the
filter.
For
this
reason,
this
method
of
creating
weights
with
a
filter
is
often
referred
to
as
the
“sliding
windows”
technique.
The
output
from
the
filters
being
moved
around
the
entire
input
image
is
a
two-dimensional
array
representing
the
whole
image.
This
array
is
called
a
“feature
map”
.
Why
Convolutions
are
Essential
What
is
the
purpose
of
creating
convolutions
anyway?
Convolutions
are
necessary
because
a
neural
network
has
to
be
able
to
interpret
the
pixels
in
an
image
as
numerical
values.
The
function
of
the
convolutional
layers
is
to
convert
the
image
into
numerical
values
that
the
neural
network
can
interpret
and
then
extract
relevant
patterns
from.
The
job
of
the
filters
in
the
convolutional
network
is
to
create
a
two-dimensional
array
of
values
that
can
be
passed
into
the
later
layers
of
a
neural
network,
those
that
will
learn
the
patterns
in
the
image.
Filters
And
Channels

CNNs
don’t
use
just
one
filter
to
learn
patterns
from
the
input
images.
Multiple
filters
are
used
,
as
the
different
arrays
created
by
the
different
filters
leads
to
a
more
complex,
rich
representation
of
the
input
image.
Common
numbers
of
filters
for
CNNs
are
32,
64,
128,
and
512.
The
more
filters
there
are,
the
more
opportunities
the
CNN
has
to
examine
the
input
data
and
learn
from
it.
A
CNN
analyzes
the
differences
in
pixel
values
in
order
to
determine
the
borders
of
objects.
In
a
grayscale
image,
the
CNN
would
only
look
at
the
differences
in
black
and
white,
light-to-dark
terms.
When
the
images
are
color
images,
not
only
does
the
CNN
take
dark
and
light
into
account,
but
it
has
to
take
the
three
different
color
channels
&#8211;
red,
green,
and
blue
&#8211;
into
account
as
well.
In
this
case,
the
filters
possess
3
channels,
just
like
the
image
itself
does.
The
number
of
channels
that
a
filter
has
is
referred
to
as
its
depth,
and
the
number
of
channels
in
the
filter
must
match
the
number
of
channels
in
the
image.
Convolutional
Neural
Network
(CNN)
Architecture
Let’s
take
a
look
at
the
complete
architecture
of
a
convolutional
neural
network.
A
convolutional
layer
is
found
at
the
beginning
of
every
convolutional
network,
as
it’s
necessary
to
transform
the
image
data
into
numerical
arrays.
However,
convolutional
layers
can
also
come
after
other
convolutional
layers,
meaning
that
these
layers
can
be
stacked
on
top
of
one
another.
Having
multiple
convolutional
layers
means
that
the
outputs
from
one
layer
can
undergo
further
convolutions
and
be
grouped
together
in
relevant
patterns.
Practically,
this
means
that
as
the
image
data
proceeds
through
the
convolutional
layers,
the
network
begins
to
“recognize”
more
complex
features
of
the
image.
The
early
layers
of
a
ConvNet
are
responsible
for
extracting
the
low-level
features,
such
as
the
pixels
that
make
up
simple
lines.
Later
layers
of
the
ConvNet
will
join
these
lines
together
into
shapes.
This
process
of
moving
from
surface-level
analysis
to
deep-level
analysis
continues
until
the
ConvNet
is
recognizing
complex
shapes
like
animals,
human
faces,
and
cars.
After
the
data
has
passed
through
all
of
the
convolutional
layers,
it
proceeds
into
the
densely
connected
part
of
the
CNN.
The
densely-connected
layers
are
what
a
traditional
feed-forward
neural
network
looks
like,
a
series
of
nodes
arrayed
into
layers
that
are
connected
to
one
another.
The
data
proceeds
through
these
densely
connected
layers,
which
learns
the
patterns
that
were
extracted
by
the
convolutional
layers,
and
in
doing
so
the
network
becomes
capable
of
recognizing
objects.
