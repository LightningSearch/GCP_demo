This
is
a
guest
blog
post
by
Steve
Boms,
President
of
Allon
Advocacy
.
Boms,
a
featured
speaker
and
panelist
at
FinovateFall
2019
last
month,
takes
a
look
at
the
current
regulatory
landscape
in
the
United
States
when
it
comes
to
data
privacy,
and
why
he
thinks
we&#8217;re
a
long
way
off
from
having
a
one-size-fits-all
approach.
Steve
Boms,
President,
Allon
Advocacy
sits
down
with
David
Penn,
Research
Analyst
at
Finovate
to
talk
regtech,
open
banking
and
the
intersection
of
two
within
fintech
&amp;
politics.
Data
breaches
have
dominated
the
headlines
recently,
but
a
federal
standard
is
still
a
pipe
dream
in
the
current
political
environment.
Why?
The
answer
is
as
old
as
the
country
itself:
the
tension
between
state
and
federal
power.
In
the
current
context,
it
is
Republicans,
typically
strident
defenders
of
states’
rights,
who
want
a
national
system.
House
Energy
and
Commerce
Committee
Ranking
Member
Greg
Walden
(R-Ore.)
has
said,
“Your
privacy
and
security
should
not
change
depending
on
where
you
live
in
the
United
States.”
Industry
advocates
agree
with
the
GOP,
arguing
for
a
national
standard
because
they
worry
compliance
across
50
different
state
frameworks
would
be
impossible.
Though
several
bills
outlining
national
standards
have
been
introduced
in
Congress,
including
some
with
Democratic
support,
the
two
parties
still
cannot
agree.
That’s
because
Democrats,
along
with
consumer
groups
and
privacy
advocates,
repeatedly
have
said
they
will
not
support
federal
legislation
that
supplants
current
and
future
state
laws
that
may
be
stronger
than
a
federal
privacy
regime.
&nbsp;
Given
this
ideological
argument,
federal
action
could
still
be
years
away.
If
you
want
progress
fast,
better
to
look
to
the
states.
Data
privacy
legislation
has
been
introduced
or
filed
in
at
least
25
states.
Maine
and
Nevada
enacted
significant
legislation
this
year.
Colorado
and
Massachusetts
also
did,
and
proponents
of
data
privacy
legislation
are
active
in
New
York.
Connecticut
lawmakers
failed
to
consider
several
data
privacy
bills,
but
did
pass
legislation
to
establish
a
task
force
to
examine
what
businesses
operating
in
the
state
should
have
to
tell
consumers
about
the
data
they
collect.
This
trend
–
studying
the
issue
–
is
evident
in
several
states,
and
while
such
“study
bills”
are
sometimes
viewed
as
bureaucratic
inertia
against
more
powerful
legislation,
these
mandates
are
quite
often
precursors
to
more
meaningful
statutory
changes.
That
certainly
could
be
the
case
over
the
next
year.
The
gold
standard
for
state
legislation
is,
of
course,
the
California
Consumer
Privacy
Act
(CCPA)
that
is
set
to
go
into
effect
on
January
1,
2020.
In
arguing
against
a
uniform
federal
standard,
it
is
the
CCPA
that
Democrats
are
hoping
to
preserve.
Even
though
it
will
take
several
months,
even
years,
to
reach
consensus,
it
is
difficult
to
envision
an
eventual
federal
mandate
that
doesn’t
look
a
lot
like
the
CCPA.
The
CCPA
addresses
numerous
measures
that
empower
consumers
to
protect
their
data
privacy,
a
common
theme
lawmakers,
industry,
and
consumer
advocates
all
embrace.
Specifically,
the
CCPA
allows
consumers
to
opt
out
of
the
sale
of
their
information
while
embracing
their
right
to
know,
access,
and
delete
what
companies
know
about
them.
The
law
also
includes
a
45-day
grace
period
for
businesses
to
comply
with
consumers’
requests
and
imposes
penalties
on
companies
for
privacy
violations,
including
the
ability
for
consumers
to
exercise
private
rights
of
action
for
a
security
breach.
California
lawmakers
have
introduced
numerous
bills
since
CCPA
passage
to
clarify
the
law’s
prior
to
implementation.
Amendments
include
the
removal
of
certain
categories
of
data
–
namely
employee
and
contractor
information
–and
the
need
to
protect
businesses’
preferred
treatment
of
consumers
who
are
part
of
loyalty
programs.
These
changes
might
not
be
enacted,
but
they
present
debates
federal
lawmakers
should
watch.
Even
with
the
CCPA
as
a
guide,
federal
legislation
must
strike
an
appropriate
balance
between
supporting
consumer
empowerment
and
supporting
strong
protection
standards
for
consumers
and
businesses
alike.
Additionally,
a
major
question
still
lingers
in
Washington
over
who
should
have
authority
over
data
privacy
issues,
and
whether
they
should
have
the
authority
to
establish
rules
or
enforce
current
practices.
A
Government
Accountability
Office
(GAO)
report
points
to
the
Federal
Trade
Commission
(FTC)
as
the
most
reasonable
choice.
Many
in
the
industry
agree,
citing
the
agency’s
authority
to
weed
out
“unfair
or
deceptive”
consumer
practices
and
the
FTC’s
existing
authority
to
issue
and
enforce
regulations
on
the
collection
of
data
on
children
under
13
years
old.
In
its
report,
however,
the
GAO
does
question
whether
the
FTC
has
the
bandwidth
to
oversee
such
an
enormous
issue,
or
if
a
new
governing
arm,
similar
to
the
European
Union’s
European
Data
Protection
Supervisor,
should
be
established.
The
most
important
issue
facing
federal
lawmakers,
though,
is
the
need
to
protect
innovation.
The
GAO
urges
Congress
to
consider
how
to
“balance
consumers’
need
for
internet
privacy
with
the
industry’s
ability
to
provide
services
and
innovate.”
Strict
privacy
regulations
may
result
in
compliance
costs
that
are
too
cumbersome
for
businesses,
and
consumer
skepticism
increases
when
privacy
protections
are
too
lax.
Europe
is
starting
to
feel
the
effects
of
the
General
Data
Privacy
Regulation’s
(GDPR)
inability
to
balance
the
two
(many
U.S.
businesses
are
not
able
to
comply
with
the
regulation’s
excessively
high
bar
or
cannot
pay
the
large
fees
and
thus
cannot
offer
their
services).
Data
privacy
is
front
and
center
on
the
global
stage.
The
United
States
will
fall
farther
behind
unless
lawmakers
focus
on
the
common
tenets
of
data
privacy
–
supporting
consumer
control,
ensuring
proper
regulatory
authority,
and
embracing
innovation
–
and
pass
a
bipartisan
bill.

The
fintech
space
is
filled
with
new
players
bringing
to
market
new
innovations
and
solutions
to
old
business
and
consumer
problems,
as
well
as
traditional
businesses
looking
to
develop
in-house
innovation
teams
and
partner
with
start-ups.
But
what
they
both
have
in
common
is
a
desire
to
meet
and
exceed
changing
customer
demands,
make
financial
services
more
accessible
and
user-friendly,
and
keep
up
with
the
fast-paced
technological
advances.
During
FinovateFall,
we
sat
down
with
the
experts
on
the
ground
to
ask
them
about
what&#8217;s
driving
the
fintech
ecosystem
where
they
work.
Andrew
Boyajian,
Head
of

&#8211;
Personal
Insurance
at
AIG
on
the
importance
of
an
innovation
branch
in
the
business
and
why
they
should
work
hand-in-hand
with
start-ups.
David
Snitkof,
Head
of
Data
Integration
&amp;
Insights
at
Kabbage
discusses
leveraging
data
and
why
it
should
be
more
than
just
plugging
in
some
numbers
to
get
an
output.
Christian
Zimmerman,
Co-founder
&amp;
CEO,
Qoins
on
the
pain
points
which
lead
him
to
Qoins
and
what
the
future
has
in-store
for
crowd-funding
to
pay
back
loans.

technology
shared
between
the
different
sides.
We
sat
down

banks
and
financial
institutions
can

this
new
era.
