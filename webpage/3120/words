Whether
your
organization’s
goal
is
to
delight
customers
or
improve
healthcare
outcomes,
one
of
the
biggest
challenges
is
finding
the
right
data
to
answer
your
questions.
Data
insights
can
be
the
difference
between
timely
treatment
and
hospital
capacity
issues,
or
understanding
consumer
trends
and
losing
sales
to
competitors.
Saving
time,
increasing
efficiency
or
arriving
in
the
nick
of
time
for
the
right
opportunity
often
requires
data
resources
beyond
what
any
individual
or
organization
can
process
alone.
That’s
why
there’s
growing
interest
in
data
partnerships
and
data
sharing—to
give
organizations
the
breadth
and
depth
of
insight
needed
to
solve
difficult
problems
when
there’s
little
margin
for
error.

The
City
of
New
York
entered
the
eye
of
the
storm
when
the
Covid-19
pandemic
hit
the
United
States.
Yet
one
of
the
bright
spots
of
2020
has
been
a
cooperative
effort
around
data
that’s
been
guiding
the
city’s
response
to
the
pandemic.
As
New
York
City
became
the
epicenter
of
the
virus
in
March,
city
analysts
who
typically
deliver
data
insights
to
policymakers
pivoted
to
focus
on
the
health
crisis.
Most
critically,
they
analyzed
data
to
assess
ICU
capacity
and
relayed
this
information
to
emergency
medical
services
staff
across
the
city.
The
timely
information
led
first
responders
to
divert
the
most
acute
patients
from
overburdened
facilities
to
those
with
available
beds.&nbsp;
In
July,
the
city
launched
the
NYC
Recovery
Data
Partnership
,
an
initiative
to
facilitate
data
sharing
among
community,
nonprofit
and
private
organizations
to
aid
response
and
recovery
efforts.
The
partnership
allows
analysts
to
tap
into
a
wide
range
of
data
from
more
than
a
dozen
member
groups
to
not
only
help
leaders
understand
various
impacts
of
the
virus,
but
also
empower
innovative
responses.&nbsp;
In
scenarios
that
necessitate
prompt
insights
and
swift
action
like
the
pandemic,
this
type
of
data
partnership
offers
a
comprehensive
view
of
available
data
so
people
can
come
together
to
quickly
solve
complex
problems.&nbsp;&nbsp;
At
its
foundation,
a
data
partnership
involves
sharing
between
two
or
more
parties
in
pursuit
of
a
broader
goal,
often
with
a
long-term
strategic
horizon
or
a
big-picture
reward
in
mind.
“A
data
partnership
usually
delivers
a
missing
piece
of
the
puzzle
for
each
side
of
the
agreement.
When
utilized
correctly,
it
enables
better
service-delivery
or
more
informed
decision
making,”
said
Anthony
Young,
a
senior
manager
of
solution
engineering
at
Tableau.&nbsp;
In
the
city,
those
benefits
may
include
less
crowded
hospitals,
accelerated
care
delivery
and
better
outcomes
for
Covid-19
patients.&nbsp;
With
data
on
Covid-19
test
results,
insights
into
neighborhood
foot
traffic
and
up-to-date
information
on
business
operating
hours,
the
partnership
is
also
well
positioned
to
help
authorities
determine
which
targeted
control
measures
might
contain
outbreaks.
<fbs-ad
position="top"
progressive
ad-id="article-0-top">
The
data
partnerships
forged
to
fight
the
pandemic
offer
models
for
forward-thinking
businesses
that
see
the
value
in
sharing
data
to
build
resilience
amid
uncertainty
and
discover
new
revenue
opportunities.&nbsp;
When
the
pandemic
disrupted
supply
chains,
for
example,
brands
looked
to
fill
gaps
in
their
knowledge
by
augmenting
internal
data
sets
with
public
data
sets,
as
well
as
with
data
from
business
partners.
By
combining
data
to
create
a
fuller
picture,
brands
looked
for
ways
to
source
materials
from
alternative
locations,
move
products
across
consumer
locations
to
fill
gaps
downstream
and
sell
products
in
new
markets
when
intended
markets
could
not
be
accessed.
The
pandemic
shifted
business
norms
and
made
existing
performance
measurement
unreliable.
This
propelled
leaders
who
once
relied
primarily
on
internal
data
for
strategic
decision
making
to
look
outside
of
their
own
four
walls.
As
Covid-19
surged,
leaders
were
keen
to
monitor
the
competitive
landscape
to
learn
from
reopened
markets
and
companies
that
had
launched
successful
e-commerce
alternatives,
adapting
their
own
responses
based
on
new
insights.&nbsp;
“Clients
who
would
normally
ask
for
a
data
engineer
to
blend
their
product
and
customer
data
for
a
report
started
asking
for
ways
to
monetize
the
insights
they
have
and
for
recommendations
on
good
datasets
to
shop
for
to
augment
those
in-house
insights,”
said
Amer
Numan,
director
of
data
and
analytics
at
Slalom,
a
global
consulting
firm
focused
on
business
transformation.
“Decisions
enabled
by
sharing
and
blending
external
data
are
more
specific
and
impactful
than
ever
because
they
are
based
on
more
context
than
ever
before.”
The
value
of
data
sharing
is
especially
high
for
retailers
and
consumer
goods
manufacturers,
said
Numan.
A
reopened
region
could
inform
closed
regions
about
how
consumer
behavior
and
traffic
are
changing,
for
example,
while
an
e-commerce
marketplace
could
offer
insights
on
new
trends,
seasonality
and
specific
metrics
like
conversion
and
basket
size
across
different
product
categories.
<fbs-ad
position="topx"
progressive
ad-id="article-0-topx-1">
“One
example
of
a
game-changing
data
provider
would
be
a
luxury
department
store
with
a
strong
online
presence,”
said
Numan.
“Combining
data
from
foot
traffic
sensors,
web
visits,
sales,
social
media
posts
and
promotions
and
product
attributes
can
be
an
enormous
win
for
a
brand
that
is
on
those
shelves
and
websites.
It
can
tell
a
brand
which
varieties
are
selling,
how
many
people
who
see
the
product
opt
to
buy
it
and
even
what
is
being
purchased
alongside
it.”
“Imagine
the
possibilities
when
you
know,
with
a
very
high
degree
of
confidence,
that
you
should
present
a
specific
type
of
product,
at
an
exact
price
point,
for
a
particular
ZIP
code,
in
a
defined
timeframe,
to
achieve
a
guaranteed
sale.
It’s
the
holy
grail
in
data-driven
business
planning,”
said
Numan.&nbsp;
Of
course
there
are
challenges
that
accompany
data
sharing,
says
Numan.
“The
chief
concern
in
executing
this
has
been
data
security—the
ability
to
obtain
and
share
specific
data
elements
without
compromising
intellectual
property
and
highly
proprietary
information,”
he
said.
“This
is
why
a
shared
cloud
repository
for
data
to
be
presented
and
accessed
is
imperative,
and
why
secure
virtual
data
platforms
have
dominated
the
data
marketplace
this
year.”
Data
partnerships
operate
best
when
fueled
by
data
from
a
wide
range
of
partners.
Here
are
examples
of
the
kinds
of
insights
retailers,
suppliers
and
other
collaborators
can
contribute
in
a
data
sharing
scenario:
Retailers:
Data
on
which
products
are
selling
and
how
sales
are
being
made—not
just
color,
quantity
and
location,
but
also
product
placement,
foot
traffic,
conversion
rates,
promotions
and
discounting.
Suppliers:
Data
on
raw
material
stock
levels
and
lead
times,
downstream
distribution
alternatives,
warehoused
products
that
can
quickly
be
moved
to
a
higher-performing
region
and
options
for
new
formulations.
Media
partners:
Insights
on
competitive
purchases,
web
searches
for
fashion
trends
and
engagement
with
fashion
influencers
on
social
media,
along
with
sentiment
analysis
on
consumer
engagement
and
which
factors
are
likely
to
convert
to
sales.&nbsp;
Other
commercial
partners:
Demographic
data
on
purchases
and
spending
habits,
such
as
insights
into
whether
the
buyer
ever
flies
first-class,
drinks
alcohol
or
wears
a
sports
team’s
colors.
<fbs-ad

For
data
sharing
initiatives
to
thrive,
senior
leaders
need
to
play
an
active
role.
While
the
concept
may
be
new
and
somewhat
unfamiliar
to
organizations
that
typically
rely
on
internal
or
proprietary
data,
the
potential
benefits
of
data
sharing
are
significant,
and
worth
exploring.

Data
sharing
and
data
partnerships
will
help
organizations
address
significant
humanitarian
and
logistical
challenges
in
the
months

years
ahead
by
focusing

best
