The
AI
Podcast
Welcome
to
the
AI
Podcast.
Artificial
intelligence
has
been
described
as
“Thor’s
Hammer“
and
“the
new
electricity.”
But
it’s
also
a
bit
of
a
mystery
–
even
to
those
who
know
it
best.
We’ll
connect
with
some
of
the
world’s
leading
experts
in
AI,
deep
learning
and
machine
learning
to
explain
how
it
works,
how
it’s
evolving
and
how
it
intersects
with
every
facet
of
human
endeavor,
from
art
to
science.
We
release
new
episodes
about
every
other
week.

Our
Guests
Few
things
are
more
interesting
than
good
conversation.
And,
right
now,
few
things
are
more
worthy
of
a
good
conversation
than
AI.
Driven
by
deep
learning
—
a
technology
that’s
mysterious
even
to
some
of
the
people
who
have
conjured
it
—
AI
is
remaking
everything
in
the
world
around
us.
And
that’s
given
us
an
opportunity
to
speak
to
some
of
the
smartest
people
in
the
world
about
some
of
today’s
most
interesting
trends.
Our
Hosts

long-time
