AI
has
the
potential
to
be
used
by
rogue
states,
as
well
as
by
malicious
bad
actors.
Below
we
feature
the
top
organizations
that
are
committed
to
ensuring
that
artificial
intelligence
is
used
safely.
Algorithmic
Justice
League
&#8211;
One
of
the
most
important
issues
is
Algorithmic
Bias.
This
can
take
many
forms
and
shapes,
including
being
biased
against
gender,
ethnicity,
age,
or
race.
The
Algorithmic
Justice
League
aims
to
develop
practices
to
enable
accountability
in
the
design,
development,
and
deployment
of
coded
systems.
AI
4
All
&#8211;
Powered
by
a
network
of
Universities
including
Berkeley,
and
Columbia
University,
AI
4
All
is
a
nonprofit
that
works
to
increase
both
gender
and
ethnic
diversity
in
AI
development.
They
have
created
pipeline
for
talent
which
may
be
underrepresented
in
the
form
of
mentorships
programs
and
educational
opportunities
in
both
the
USA
and
Canada.
AI
Ethics
Lab
&#8211;
They
bring
together
collaborators
from
different
fields
including
computer
scientists,
lawyers,
scholars,
and
philosophers,
to
discuss
and
bring
about
a
solutions
based
approach
to
ethically
designing
AI.
The
workshops
are
deeply
interesting
and
will
discuss
everything
from
transhumanism,
biases
in
image
search
results,
to
issues
brought
up
by
popular
entertainment
such
as
black
mirror
episodes.
AI
Now
Institute
&#8211;
An
interdisciplinary
research
center
at
New
York
University,
they
are
committed
to
focusing
on
the
social
implications
of
AI,
with
a
special
emphasis
on
&#8216;Rights
&amp;
Liberties&#8217;,
&#8216;Labor
&amp;
Automation&#8217;,
&#8216;Bias
&amp;
Inclusion&#8217;,
and
&#8216;Safety
&amp;
Critical
Infrastructure&#8217;.
Foundation
for
Responsible
Robotics
 -They
wish
to
shape
a
future
of
responsible
artificial
intelligence
and
robotics
design.
This
includes
development,
use
cases,
regulation,
and
deployment.
Addressing
ethics
behind
robots
and
the
impact
of
innovations
in
this
space
on
social
values
such
as
privacy,
and
well-being
are
the
core
focus.
Future
of
Life
Institute
&#8211;
An
ambitious
goal
of
catalyzing
and
supporting
research
which
will
safeguard
life
from
AI,
all
while
developing
realistic
and
optimistic
visions
for
the
future.
They
offer
great
interviews,
articles,
and
more
on
many
important
issues
of
our
time
from
climate
change,
nuclear
proliferation,
to
biotech,
and
AI.
Institute
for
Electrical
and
Electronics
Engineers
&#8211;
They
communicate
the
vision
of
creating
standards,
certifications,
and
a
code
of
conduct
which
will
enable
the
ethical
implementation
of
AI
technologies.
They
believe
that
it
is
vitally
important
that
stake
holders
are
empowered
to
leader
with
ethics
first
when
it
comes
to
AI
implementations
that
can
benefit
society.
Machine
Intelligence
Research
Institute
&#8211;
More
technically
oriented
then
most
organizations,
they
are
a
nonprofit
that
studies
mathematical
formulas
and
underpinnings
of
intelligence.
They
wish
to
create
tools
and
systems
to
design
and
analyze
artificial
general
intelligence
(AGI).
The
systems
are
created
to
be
as
transparent
as
possible
so
that
humans
are
capable
of
understanding
the
reasons
why
AI
behaves
in
certain
ways.
Open
AI
&#8211;
This
is
the
most
popular
organization
as
it
received
a
huge
funding
boost
from
Elon
Musk,
and
has
Sam
Altman
as
CEO.
The
mission
is
to
ensure
at
artificial
general
intelligence
(AGI)
is
developed
with
the
goal
of
always
benefiting
humanity.
Safe,
beneficial,
and
regulated
AGI
is
the
goal.
They
release
regular
research
papers
which
advance
safety,
policy,
and
AI
capabilities.
The
Partnership
on
AI
&#8211;
They
aim
to
conduct
research,
organize
discussions,
and
provide
educational
material
which
will
benefit
humanity.
They
also
deliver
AI
policy
and
ethics
research
for
ambitious
projects
and
they
offer
a
fellowship
program
for
this.
