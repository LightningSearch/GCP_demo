Dutch
financial
services
corporation
ING
announced
today
it
is
spinning
off
Katana
into
its
own
entity
called
Katana
Labs.
As
a
part
of
its
move
to
independence,
Katana
has
closed
$3.9
million
in
funding,
half
of
which
ING
contributed
&#8220;to
enable
further
growth
and
to
pave
the
way
for
an
independent
future
for
Katana.&#8221;
Katana
began
as
one
of
25
of
ING&#8217;s
innovation
initiatives.
The
project
follows
in
the
footsteps
of
Yolt
and
Cobase,
former
ING
innovation
initiatives
that
scaled
up
outside
of
ING&#8217;s
labs.
“Supported
by
ING
Labs,
we
developed,
tested
and
validated
the
technology.
Now
it’s
time
to
move
to
the
next
phase
as
an
independent
fintech,&#8221;
said
Santiago
Braje,
CEO
of
Katana.
&#8220;We
are
very
excited
about
the
opportunities
we
see
in
developing
our
platform
and
expanding
our
client
base.”
ING
launched
Katana
to
help
traders
leverage
predictive
analytics
to
determine
bond
pricing
based
on
historic
and
real
time
data.
In
2018,
ING
enhanced
the
tool
with
the
launch
of
Katana
Lens
,
a
tool
for
bond
market
investors
that
identifies
the
most
promising
trades
based
on
historical
data.
Last
year,
Global
Finance
Magazine
highlighted
Katana
as
Innovator
2019
.
“In
the
past
few
years,
Katana
has
managed
to
grow
from
an
internal
innovation
project
to
a
serious
value
proposition
for
bond
investors.
We
attracted
major
clients
who
see
the
added
value
of
this
super
smart
AI-tool.
I’m
proud
that
with
our
support
Katana
grew
out
to
a
fully-grown
fintech
that
is
ready
for
an
independent
future,”
said
Annerie
Vreugdenhil,
head
of
Innovation
at
ING
Wholesale
Banking.
Katana
Labs
has
incorporated
in
the
U.K.
and
is
now
headquartered
in
London.

Mergers

Acquisitions
<!--<div

Lending
solutions
provider
Open
Lending
has
agreed
to
merge
with
Nebula
Acquisition
Corporation,
an
acquisition
company
sponsored
by
True
Wind
Capital.
The
merger
will
take
place
via
an
acquisition
in
which,
once
finalized,
Nebula
will
purchase
Open
Lending
and
form
a
new
Delaware
holding
company
called
Open
Lending
Corporation
.
The
new
entity
will
be
publicly-traded
on
NASDAQ
with
an
estimated
value
of
$1.3
billion.
Members
of
Open
Lending&#8217;s
executive
team&#8211;
John
Flynn,
cofounder,
president,
and
CEO;
and
Ross
Jessup,
cofounder,
CFO,
and
COO&#8211;
will
lead
the
new
company.
Flynn
commented
that
there
is
&#8220;significant
runway&#8221;
for
new
growth,
considering
Open
Lending&#8217;s
existing
banking
relationships
and
&#8220;untapped
opportunities&#8221;
with
new
partnerships.
Open
Lending
was
founded
in
2000
and
offers
automated
lending
solutions
to
banks,
specializing
in
automotive
lending.
Ultimately,
Open
Lending
helps
banks
offer
near-prime
borrowers
more
attractive
borrowing
rates
without
changing
the
risk
profile
for
the
bank.
In
2019,
Open
Lending
facilitated
more
than
$1.7
billion
in
automotive
loans
for
275+
financial
institutions.
&#8220;Open
Lending&#8217;s
ability
to
demonstrate
consistent
organic
growth
and
high
levels
of
profitability
represents
an
exciting
investment
opportunity
within
the
risk-based
analytics
ecosystem,&#8221;
said
Adam
Clammer,
Nebula
co-CEO
and
founding
partner
of
True
Wind.
&#8220;John
and
his
team
have
developed
a
highly-scalable
technology
platform
that
helps
hard
working
consumers
get
into
a
new
or
used
car
at
the
best
rate
possible.
We
look
forward
to
partnering
with
Open
Lending&#8217;s
management
team
and
Bregal
at
this
exciting
inflection
point
in
the
company&#8217;s
growth.&#8221;

B-North
Lands
$2.6
Million
Ahead
of
Launch

Funding
<!--<div
class="sharing">
-->
E.U.-based
alternative
lending
company
B-North
announced
this
week
it
landed
$2.6
million
(£2
million)
in
new
funding.
The
investment
comes
as
part
of
crowdfunding
efforts
via
Crowdcube
and
Growthfunders.
Combined
with
the
$5.5
million
(£4.2
million)
the
company
has
already
raised,
today&#8217;s
round
brings
B-North&#8217;s
total
funding
to
just
over
$8
million,
according
to
FSTech.
The
company
will
use
the
new
capital
to
increase
its
workforce
and
boost
its
infrastructure.
While
B-North
has
yet
to
launch,
the
company
plans
to
do
so
in
&#8220;mid-2020.&#8221;
Taking
a
step
in
that
direction,
last
month
B-North
partnered
with
Newcastle
Strategic
Solutions,
which
will
provide
a
deposit-taking
solution
for
the
new
lender.
While
there
are
multiple
alternative
lending
companies
in
the
fintech
sector,
B-North
aims
to
differentiate
itself
by
lending
up
to
10x
faster
than
incumbent
players,
placing
core
banking
functions
closer
to
the
customer,
and
tapping
its
commercial
ﬁnance
broker
channels
for
distribution.
Much
of
this
will
be
accomplished
through
&#8220;lending
pods,&#8221;
as
the
company
calls
them,
which
will
launch
across
Manchester
in
the
second
half
of
this
year.
B-North
was
founded
in
2015.
Jonathan
Thompson
is
co-founder
and
CEO.

Mastercard
Snaps
Up
RiskRecon

<!--<div

Mastercard,
the
world&#8217;s
second-largest
payment
processor,
has
acquired
AI
and
data
analytics
solutions
company
RiskRecon.
Terms
of
the
deal
were
not
disclosed.
The
payments
giant
anticipates
the
purchase
will
help
its
clients
defend
against
cyber
threats
and
data
breaches.
Ajay
Bhalla,
president
of
cyber
and
intelligence
for
Mastercard,
said
that
RiskRecon
will
boost
Mastercard&#8217;s
cyber
security
solutions.
“Through
a
powerful
combination
of
AI
and
data-driven
advanced
technology,
RiskRecon
offers
an
exciting
opportunity
to
complement
our
existing
strategy
and
technology
to
secure
the
cyber
space,”
Bhalla
added.
Logistically,
RiskRecon
will
remain
in
tact.
While
the
Utah-based
company
is
now
dedicated
to
supporting
Mastercard
solutions,
RiskRecon
will
continue
to
help
other
industries
such
as
healthcare
and
manufacturing
protect
consumer
and
payment
data,
as
well
as
intellectual
property.
RiskRecon
was
founded
in
2015
by
Eric
Blatte
and
Kelly
White,
who
now
serves
as
the
company&#8217;s
CEO.
“By
becoming
part
of
their
team,
we
have
an
opportunity
to
scale
our
solution
and
help
companies
in
new
industries
and
geographies
take
steps
to
better
manage
their
cybersecurity
risk,”
White
said.
Prior
to
today&#8217;s
acquisition,
RiskRecon
had
raised
$40
million
in
three
rounds
of
funding.
