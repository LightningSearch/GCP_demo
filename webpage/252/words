Dr.
Lingjia
Tang,
CTO
and
Co-Founder
of
Clinc
,
is
a
professor
of
Computer
Science
at
The
University
of
Michigan.
Dr.
Tang’s
research
in
building
large-scale
production
infrastructure
for
intelligent
applications
is
widely
recognized
and
respected
in
the
academic
community.
In
addition
to
working
at
both
Microsoft
and
Google,
Lingjia
received
her
PhD
in
Computer
Science
from
the
University
of
Virginia.
Lingjia
has
recently
received
prestigious
awards
including
ISCA
Hall
of
Fame,
Facebook
Research
Awards
and
Google
research
Award.
What
initially
attracted
you
to
AI?
When
did
you
first
discover
that
you
wanted
to
launch
an
AI
business?
In
the
mid-2000s
I
was
performing
research
around
large-scale
systems
that
support
various
applications
and
how
we
can
design
servers
as
a
software
system
to
run
those
applications
more
efficiently.
At
the
time,
we
were
shifting
from
working
with
traditional
web
applications
to
more
machine
learning
-driven
functions.
That&#8217;s
when
I
started
to
pay
attention
to
the
algorithms
associated
with
AI
and
gained
interest
in
fundamentally
understanding
how
AI
applications
work.
Soon
after,
the
research
team
I
was
working
with
decided
to
pivot
and
basically
build
our
own
AI
applications
as
benchmarks
to
study,
which
is
what
led
us
to
publishing
our
first
few
research
papers
and
developing
our
first
product,
Sirius—an
open
end-to-end
voice
and
vision
personal
assistant.
As
an
open
source
software,
Sirius
allowed
people
to
build
conversational
virtual
assistants
on
their
own.
At
the
time,
this
was
a
very
limited
capability
for
the
general
public
and
was
really
only
controlled
by
the
big
companies,
such
as
Google
and
Apple.
However,
we
saw
that
we
were
filling
a
critical
gap
when
we
released
the
software
and
saw
that
it
had
tens
of
thousands
of
downloads
in
the
first
week!
That
was
the
turning
point
where
we
knew
there
was
a
lot
of
market
demand
for
this
type
of
software.
Come
2015,
we
launched
Clinc
with
the
mindset
that
we
would
be
able
to
provide
everyone
–
every
developer,
company,
person—who
wants
to
be
able
to
build
a
virtual
assistant
with
the
access
to
expertise,
tooling
and
innovation
to
be
able
to
do
that.
Clinc
offers
conversational
AI
solutions
without
relying
on
keywords
or
scripts.
Could
you
go
into
some
details
regarding
how
this
is
achieved?
What
are
some
of
the
Natural
Language
Processing
(NLP)
challenges
that
had
to
be
overcome?
What
really
sets
Clinc
apart
from
other
conversational
AI
platforms
on
the
market
is
its
underlying
AI
algorithms
that
enable
its
“human
in
the
room”
experience,
which
understands
messy
and
unscripted
language.
This
allows
for
corrections
to
backtrack
and
“heal”
mistakes
made
in
human
conversation
and
enables
complex
conversational
flows—conversations
that
a
real
human
would
be
able
to
understand.
In
contrast
to
a
speech-to-text
word
matching
algorithm,
Clinc
analyzes
dozens
of
factors
from
the
user’s
input
including
wording,
sentiment,
intent,
tone
of
voice,
time
of
day,
location
and
relationships,
and
uses
those
factors
to
deliver
an
answer
that
represents
a
composite
of
knowledge
extracted
from
its
trained
brain.
For
example,
if
I
ask
my
virtual
assistant,
“how
much
money
did
I
spend
on
a
burger?”
it
needs
to
understand
that
I
am
asking
about
money
and
spending,
that
I
am
asking
specifically
about
a
hamburger
and
that
a
hamburger
is
a
type
of
food
and
should
be
matched
to
my
recent
spending
at
a
restaurant.
Achieving
this
level
of
understanding
is
not
easy.
In
general,
we
would
break
down
conversational
AI
into
two
components:
Natural
Language
Understanding
(NLU)
and
dialog
management.
So,
the
challenge
that
we
had
to
overcome
was
figuring
out
how
to
build
a
system
that
can
extract
key
pieces
of
information
accurately
and
can
anticipate
what
the
user
is
asking.
We
are
able
to
do
this
through
sophisticated,
contextual,
top-down
NLU,
that
is
trained
to
be
intuitive
in
nature
to
keep
up
with
the
natural
flow
of
conversation,
understanding
slang
and
context.
This
is
in
comparison
to
competitive
solutions
that
have
a
top
down,
rules-based
approach
to
Natural
Language
Processing
(NLP)
that
does
not
allow
for
conversational
healing,
meaning
if
the
customer
makes
an
error,
the
competitive
solutions
make
them
go
back
to
square
one,
wasting
time
and
only
frustrating
the
user.
We
also
use
crowdsourcing
to
extract
our
language
data
to
create
a
richer,
diverse
data
set
that
can
be
immediately
used
to
train
AI
models.
Could
you
discuss
how
deep
learning
is
used
with
the
Clinc
AI
system?
Clinc
is
using
a
hybrid
approach
to
deep
learning
where
we
use
the
traditional
old-school
model
to
some
degree
and
leverage
deep
learning
where
needed.
Specifically,
we
use
deep
learning
to
understand
words
and
languages
to
determine
the
dialogue
flow.
Generally,
our
entire
dialogue
is
a
combination
of
deep
learning
and
symbolic
AI.
We
don’t
use
deep
learning
for
language
generation
yet
because,
when
it
comes
to
our
customers
which
are
primarily
in
the
banking
industry,
there
are
a
lot
of
regulations
that
the
virtual
assistant
must
follow
that
dictate
what
they
can
and
cannot
say
to
their
customers.
So,
there
is
still
a
lot
of
uncertainty
around
whether
or
not
the
deep
learning
will
be
able
to
follow
those
set
language
restrictions.
As
of
right
now,
I
don’t
think
the
conversational
AI
community
is
completely
ready
to
fully
adopt
deep
learning
whereas
the
academic
community
is
100%
all
in,
but
I
do
look
forward
to
seeing
what
the
new
models
can
do.
What’s
the
process
for
a
company
that
wishes
to
customize
the
AI’s
responses
to
target
a
specific
audience?
Could
you
give
some
examples
of
how
Clinc
is
currently
being
used
by
clients?
We
allow
clients
to
either
license
a
platform
they
can
build
on
however
they
like,
or
take
our
fully
built
and
trained
chatbot,
Finie,
and
customize
it
and
integrate
it
into
their
apps
or
messaging
services.
Finie
can
handle
matters
related
to
balances,
transactions,
spending
history,
locating
an
ATM,
making
a
transfer
and
more.
My
favorite
example
of
how
a
client
has
customized
Clinc’s
AI
to
target
a
specific
audience
is
İşbank.
As
Turkey’s
largest
private
bank,
they
turned
to
us
to
develop
their
digital
banking
assistant,
Maxi,
back
in
2018.
To
infuse
Maxi
with
a
unique
personality,
İşbank
held
14
focus
groups
to
gauge
what
sort
of
traits
and
skills
bank
customers
wanted
in
a
virtual
assistant.
They
also
hired
a
voice
actress
to
recite
sentences
in
Turkish
related
to
banking
tasks.
İşbank’s
conversational
banking
team
came
up
with
these
sentences
by
considering
the
way
real
people
would
phrase
their
needs.
Upon
our
recommendation,
the
team
paid
participants
on
crowdsourcing
marketplaces
such
as
Amazon
Mechanical
Turk
to
supply
different
ways
they
might
express
the
same
questions,
such
as
a
request
to
view
their
balances
(“what
is
my
balance,”
“how
much
money
do
I
have
in
my
account,”
“show
me
the
cash
in
my
account”)
or
pay
a
bill
(“pay
my
bill,”
“bill
payments”).
This
example
really
shows
how
invested
İşbank
is
in
offering
a
digital
banking
assistant
to
help
their
customers
better
navigate
their
accounts.
With
Clinc,
İşbank
launched
Maxi
to
more
than
7.5
million
people,
in
Turkish.
Since
its
launch,
İşbank
has
seen
widespread
adoption
by
more
than
5.5
million
users,
with
an
average
of
9.8
interactions
per
user.
In
recent
months,
as
COVID-19
cases
increased
in
Turkey,
İşbank
swiftly
trained
Maxi
to
be
responsive
to
COVID-19-related
queries.
Since
March
2020,
Maxi
has
answered
more
than
1.2
million
customer
queries
related
to
COVID-19,
a
more
than
62%
increase
in
usage.
What
would
you
tell
women
who
are
interested
in
learning
more
about
AI
but
are
reluctant
to
get
involved
due
to
it
being
a
male
dominated
field?
Off
the
bat,
I
don’t
think
there
is
any
reason
why
AI
is
considered
a
male-dominated
field.
I
think
there
are
a
lot
of
women
pioneers
in
AI
that
are
doing
really
well
and
are
making
an
impact.
I
think
AI
coupled
with
social
policy
is
a
unique
area
that
has
the
potential
to
have
a
lot
of
impact
on
people&#8217;s
everyday
lives.
This
is
where
I
do
think
more
diverse
insights
across
the
board
would
really
benefit
us,
especially
since
there
are
a
lot
of
conversations
around
AI
bias
involving
race
and
gender.
I
believe
that
having
a
scoped
community
of
AI
developers
will
continue
to
have
a
disproportionate
impact
on
society
and
policy.
For
the
women
out
there
who
are
interested
in
joining
the
AI
field,
I
highly
recommend
it
especially
if
you
are
interested
in
making
an
impact.
AI
has
had
so
much
growth
and
innovation
over
the
years
and
it
really
is
an
exciting
time
to
be
a
part
of
it.
Is
there
anything
else
that
you
would
like
to
share
about
Clinc?
Clinc
is
making
huge
strides
right
now.
Personally,
I
have
just
stepped
into
a
new
role
as
CTO
of
Clinc
and
I
am
really
excited
to
focus
on
how
we
can
further
work
with
developers
and
data
scientists
to
grow
the
reach
of
our
technology.
As
I
look
toward
the
future,
I
see
the
demand
for
AI-powered
applications
shifting
to
enable
people
who
don&#8217;t
have
years
of
data
science
experience
and
machine
learning
background
to
be
able
to
use
it
too.
For
example,
you
don&#8217;t
have
to
have
a
graphic
design
degree
to
be
able
to
use
Photoshop.
I
think
AI
is
heading
in
that
direction
where
developers
with
no
AI
or
machine
learning
training
will
be
able
to
achieve
results
and
produce
high
quality
applications.
Overall,
we
want
to
reiterate
that
we
are
not
only
devoted
to
the
end-user
but
also
to
the
developers,
no
matter
what
level,
who
show
interest
in
our
solution.
Thank
you
for
the
great
interview,
I
look
forward
to
followin
your
progress.
Anyone
who
wishes
