Vincent
Scesa
is
the
Autonomous
Vehicle
Program
Manager
at
EasyMile
.
EasyMile
is
a
pioneer
in
driverless
technology
and
smart
mobility
solutions.
The
fast-growing
start-up
develops
software
to
automate
transportation
platforms
without
the
need
for
dedicated
infrastructure.
EasyMile&#8217;s
cutting-edge
technology
is
revolutionizing
passenger
and
goods
transportation,
offering
completely
new
mobility
options.
It
has
already
deployed
over
210
driverless
projects
with
more
than
320,000
people
transported
over
250,000
km.
What
was
it
that
initially
attracted
you
to
AI
and
robotics?
I’ve
always
been
passionate
about
all
forms
of
intelligence.
I
was
always
curious
as
a
child
and
still
am.
My
father
is
an
engineer
and
my
mother
a
psychosociologist.
This
got
me
interested.
I
realised
that
human
intelligence
is
still
much
more
advanced
than
artificial
intelligence
so
managing
the
people
that
create
the
AI
is
also
a
great
challenge.
It’s
the
combination
that
gets
me:
managing
the
people
and
teams
who
create
and
manage
the
AI.
For
as
long
as
I
can
remember,
I
have
always
been
fascinated
by
intelligence,
whatever
its
form;
computational,
gestural,
mechanical,
emotional,
collective,
strategic,
human
or
artificial.
Robotics
is
a
field
that
brings
together
so
much
of
this.
It
attracted
me
at
a
very
early
age
and
I
quickly
oriented
my
path
in
that
direction.
I
love
that
these
machines
have
computing
capacities
that
enable
them
to
analyse
complex
situations
and,
combined
with
adapted
mechanical
assemblies,
can
provide
answers
and
act
by
showing
impressive
behaviour.
This
is
what
led
me
to
couple
my
engineering
background
with
a
PhD
in
Robotics
and
Artificial
Intelligence.
I
was
able
to
work
on
decision
making
in
complex
articulated
machines
(bipedal
robots),
inspired
by
algorithms
reproducing
the
processes
found
in
the
brains
of
living
beings.
I
then
wanted
to
continue
my
professional
career
in
this
field,
trying
to
find
concrete
applications
of
these
technologies
that
would
solve
problems.
But
at
the
time
there
were
still
relatively
few
applications
for
robotics,
so
I
threw
myself
into
setting
up
companies
three
times.
The
first
focused
on
AI
for
video
games
and
robots,
the
second
on
robotics
for
monitoring
industrial
sites,
and
the
last
on
cleaning
robots
for
professionals.
&nbsp;
You
have
been
working
with
autonomous
vehicles
since
2015,
what
drew
you
to
the
space?
The
more
I
learned
about
robots
and
machines,
for
me
what
became
even
more
interesting
than
AI
and
robotics&#8230;
was
human
intelligence!
This
is
still
far
beyond
what
we
can
still
imagine
doing
with
computers
and
I
am
fascinated
by
the
combination.
So,
I
was
drawn
to
working
with
engineers
and
PhDs
who
are
experts
in
robotics
and
AI.
This
is
what
pushed
me
to
join
EasyMile
in
2015,
to
manage
human
experts
in
the
creation
of
artificial
intelligence
and
robots
in
order
to
create,
organize
and
monitor
autonomous
robotics
and
vehicle
projects
that
solve
everyday
problems.
&nbsp;
You&#8217;re
the
Project
Manager
at
EasyMile,
what
does
your
average
day
look
like?
My
days
are
usually
pretty
busy
😉
My
work
is
based
on
four
different
aspects:
Management
of
my
team
(the
technical
team
who
are
the
interface
with
our
vehicle
manufacturer
partners):
discussions
on
load
plans,
daily
management,
resolution
of
technical
situations,
facilitation
of
the
work,
training
new
staff,
reviewing
and
optimizing
our
processes.
Relationship
management
with
other
teams:
we
interact
with
all
the
other
teams
from
safety
to
fleet
management
through
navigation
and
perception
and
AI
algorithms.
I
work
hand
in
hand
with
other
managers
to
ensure
that
exchanges
between
teams
are
as
efficient
and
optimal
as
possible.
This
is
so
that
we
can
incorporate
solutions
into
the
vehicles
that
are
best
able
to
respond
to
each
platform,
while
maintaining
overall
consistency.
Responsibility
for
the
program
to
create
new
platforms
(monitoring
and
reporting):
I
am
in
charge
of
making
sure
with
the
project
managers
that
the
various
projects
we
have
are
in
line
with
schedules
and
budgets
and
that
our
partners
are
satisfied
with
our
work.
I
then
report
back
to
management
on
progress
and
status,
and
I
make
sure
to
present
any
blockages
so
that
strategic
decisions
can
be
taken
to
resolve
them.
Pre-sales
for
future
projects:
more
recently,
I
regularly
present
our
solutions
to
future
partners,
imagining
new
opportunities
and
building
the
project
plans
that
allow
us
to
help
them
meet
their
needs.
&nbsp;
Can
you
discuss
the
sensor
set
and
the
computer
vision
technology
that
is
used
in
EasyMile
autonomous
vehicles?
Taking
a
conservative
approach
to
the
sensor
suite,
EasyMile
uses
devices
from
a
number
of
market
leading
suppliers
but
is
not
committed
to
any
particular
technology
or
supplier,
and
regularly
implements
updates
every
four
to
six
months,
which
can
involve
sensor
changes.
The
current
set
of
LiDARs
integrated
into
our
EZ10
autonomous
passenger
shuttle
for
example
comes
from
Velodyne,
Valeo
and
SICK,
indeed
the
entire
sensor
set
and
the
computer
suite
are
new
in
the
vehicle.
The
purpose
of
this
change
was
to
be
able
to
see
further
and
in
greater
detail.
For
example,
the
move
to
our
next
generation
of
vehicles
included
a
change
in
the
model
of
Velodyne
LiDAR
from
the
Puck
VLP-16
to
the
Ultra
Puck
VLP-32
and
its
position
shifted
from
just
below
the
headlights
to
the
roof,
expanding
the
envelope
of
protection
that
it
provides.
The
Ultra
Puck
offers
a
120
mm
range,
360
degree
horizontal
and
40
degree
fields
of
view,
a
0.33
degree
vertical
resolution
and
advanced
features
designed
to
minimise
false
positives.
Another
addition
is
a
set
of
Scala
LiDARs
from
Valeo
mounted
on
the
corners
of
the
vehicle
and
at
the
front
down
at
valence
level.
Our
new
sensor
suite
also
features
stereo
instead
of
mono
cameras,
adding
passive
3D
depth
perception
through
binocular
vision.
The
company
has
also
integrated
IMUs
from
a
variety
of
sources
including
Continental
and
XSens.
We
are
testing
several
sensor
sets
and
the
market
is
evolving
fast.
All
our
vehicles
are
based
on
the
same
kind
of
sensors,
but
depending
on
the
size,
the
dynamics
of
the
platform
and
the
use
cases
addressed,
we
make
some
small
adjustments.
For
now
we
are
using
what
we
think
gives
us
the
best
information
on
every
part
of
our
environment,
both
close
to
the
vehicle
and
at
longer
ranges.
Complementing
the
LiDAR’s,
the
stereo
cameras
provide
input
to
EasyMile’s
deep
learning
effort,
which
is
centred
at
its
Singapore
office,
a
separate
team
that
adds
another
redundancy
layer
in
terms
of
software
development.
EasyMile’s
own
programmers
write
the
algorithms
that
interpret
sensor
data
and
apply
deep
learning
techniques
to
them.
&nbsp;
The
EasyMile
autonomous
vehicles
are
equipped
with
cybersecurity
software,
how
important
of
an
issue
is
cybersecurity?
Thinking
of
the
vehicles
we
work
with
as
equivalent
to
small,
mobile
enterprise
computing
systems,
or
even
as
data
centres
on
wheels,
makes
the
importance
of
cyber
security
obvious.
With
the
main
vehicle
computer
running
the
autonomous
systems,
the
sensor
suite,
the
communication
and
navigation
systems,
for
example,
there
can
be
20
or
so
computing
instances
connected
over
an
Ethernet
bus.
Then
there
are
the
automotive
components
such
as
batteries,
inverters
and
motors,
controllers
to
open
doors
etc,
all
of
which
run
software,
and
each
vehicle
is
connected
to
the
cloud.
This
makes
for
a
potential
“attack
surface”
that
must
be
protected.
There
are
many
different
components
on
different
networks
–
Ethernet,
CAN
bus
etc
–
and
some
off-the-shelf
components
come
with
wifi
capability.
You
have
to
make
sure
that
the
network
traffic
looks
nice,
with
no
strange
messages.
For
example,
if
your
LiDAR
is
supposed
to
send
messages
at
a
frequency
of
50
Hz
or
so,
but
you
start
to
receive
messages
at
100
Hz,
there
is
something
fishy
going
on.
What’s
more,
sensors
are
not
allowed
to
talk
to
each
other;
they
are
only
permitted
to
communicate
with
the
main
computer.
Only
the
central
computer
has
the
right
to
speak
to
everyone,
which
means
that
you
have
to
secure
this
device
very
thoroughly.
It
is
the
brain
of
the
vehicle
and
is
where
we
put
most
security.
It’s
what
we
call
a
minimised
attack
surface
because
we
close
every
possible
service
that
is
not
useful.
We
deactivate
USB
ports
and
wifi
routers,
for
example.
We
make
sure
it
is
very,
very
hard
for
someone
to
connect
to
our
computer.
Passwords
and
penetration
tests
With
many
computer
run
devices
on
every
vehicle
and
a
growing
fleet
of
vehicles
that
have
to
be
maintained
by
engineers
and
technicians,
there
are
a
lot
of
passwords
that
have
to
be
managed
securely
and
applied
in
conjunction
with
other
means
of
authenticating
people
who
need
physical
access
to
vehicles
deployed
around
the
world.
Security
is
the
main
reason
why
EasyMile
does
not
yet
install
software
upgrades
to
its
vehicles
over
the
internet,
for
the
moment
sending
one
of
their
technicians
with
a
secure
computer
to
load
the
new
software
at
the
operator’s
facility
instead.
It’s
like
upgrading
your
brain.
It
has
to
be
very,
very
secure,
and
we
prefer
to
approach
it
step
by
step.
First
you
have
to
prove
that
the
code
you
want
to
run
on
your
vehicle
is
the
same
code
that
was
written
by
EasyMile
developers,
then
you
have
to
prove
that
this
code
was
compiled
by
EasyMile
on
our
servers
and
so
on,
so
you
have
electronic
signatures
and
certificates. 
You
have
to
have
this
layer
of
assurance
just
to
make
sure
that
when
you
inject
a
new
system
you
are
100%
sure
that
it
is
the
right
system.
To
make
sure
that
all
these
measures
actually
result
in
a
secure
vehicle
and
ecosystem,
EasyMile
regularly
employs
white
hat
hackers
to
conduct
penetration
tests
Environment
hacks
In
addition
to
the
familiar
cyber
threats
and
countermeasures,
there
are
new
ones
emerging
that
target
services
and
sensors.
The
availability
of
GPS
jamming
and
spoofing
devices
is
well
known,
and
attacks
on
the
system
are
increasing,
but
hackers
are
also
targeting
sensors
such
as
cameras
and,
through
them,
the
AI
and
machine
learning
algorithms
by
subtly
altering
some
aspects
of
the
environment.
Last
year,
for
example,
a
team
from
McAfee
Advanced
Threat
Research
managed
to
trick
two
Teslas
equipped
with
Mobileye
camera
systems
by
altering
a
speed
limit
sign
using
electrical
tape
so
that
it
appeared
to
read
85
mph
instead
of
35
mph.
Tested
in
an
off-road
environment
and
with
Traffic
Aware
Cruise
Control
engaged,
both
cars
accelerated
automatically
in
response
to
the
sign
before
the
drivers
applied
the
brakes.
Some
white
hat
hacking
research
teams
are
also
looking
into
how
to
attack
LiDARs.
The
answer
to
this
type
of
threat
is
never
to
rely
on
just
a
single
sensor
or
subsystem
for
safety
critical
functions.
EasyMile
takes
this
further
by
mixing
LiDARs
from
different
suppliers.
With
three
different
brands
on
the
vehicle,
an
attacker
would
have
to
be
able
to
hack
different
LiDARs
that
don’t
work
in
the
same
way,
they
use
different
wavelengths,
for
example.
So
redundancy
is
part
of
the
security.
&nbsp;
Can
you
also
discuss
the
monitoring
and
blackbox
technology?
Originally,
the
satellite
navigation
portion
of
our
navigation
and
localisation
system
used
only
GPS,
but
the
latest
iteration
is
a
multi-GNSS
system
that
processes
GLONASS
as
well
and
will
soon
add
Galileo
and
Beidou
also.
The
system’s
precision
is
enhanced
by
Real
Time
Kinematic
(RTK)
processing.
The
GNSS
position
is
also
used
in
conjunction
with
information
from
3G
or
4G
grid.
We
use
it
very
much
for
correction.
The
overall
navigation
and
positioning
system
is
accurate
to
a
few
cms,
enabled
by
the
combination
of
GNSS,
the
LiDARs,
cameras,
inertial
system
and
odometry,
which
also
provide
redundancy
and
graceful
degradation
in
case
the
system
loses
the
GNSS
signal.
Our
vehicles
communicate
with
EasyMile’s
cloud-based
supervision
centre
via
the
3G/4G
network.
With
a
view
to
implementing
5G,
the
company
is
working
with
a
number
of
providers
around
the
world
including
SFR
in
France,
Verizon
in
the
US,
Ericsson
in
Scandinavia
and
Saudi
Telecom.
In
the
short
to
medium
term,
5G
promises
faster
feedback
from
deployed
EZ10
fleets,
boosting
both
machine
learning
and
R&amp;D,
the
ability
to
update
vehicles
faster
with
large
data
sets,
enhanced
video
surveillance
through
simultaneous
streaming
of
multiple
high-quality
video
feeds,
and
infotainment
for
passengers.
To
communicate
with
the
road
infrastructure,
our
vehicles
can
exploit
technologies
provided
by
V2X
suppliers,
through
an
onboard
unit
that
talks
to
roadside
units,
providing
information
on
the
state
of
traffic
lights,
for
example.
If
communications
with
the
supervision
centre
are
lost
longer
than
3
to
5
seconds,
the
vehicle
will
continue
to
the
next
planned
stop
and
wait
for
communication
with
the
EasyMile
server
to
be
restored
so
it
can
receive
its
next
set
of
instructions.
&nbsp;
EasyMile
has
multiple
autonomous
vehicles
on
the
road.
Could
you
give
us
some
details
on
these?
Fully
fabless,
EasyMile
licenses
its
software
technology
and
sells/rents
fully
equipped
driverless
vehicles.
It
outsources
production
to
blue-chip
manufacturers.
EasyMile
has
developed
a
complete
technology
stack
for
autonomous
vehicles
that
can
be
used
for
each
of
its
use
cases.
The
technology
is
vehicle/
platform
agnostic.
The
flagship
vehicle
this
is
found
in
is
the
EZ10
which
is
the
most
deployed
autonomous
passenger
shuttle
in
the
world.
They
carry
passengers
at
speeds
of
up
to
15
miles
per
hour
and
operate
on
a
specified
route.
They
are
used
around
the
world
to
show
how
cutting-edge
technology
will
deliver
huge
benefits
for
communities.
They
improve
public
transport
by
connecting
hubs
and
in
many
areas,
provide
a
shared
transport
service
where
there
otherwise
wasn’t
one.
They
also
offer
a
powerful
fleet
management
and
supervision
system,
one
of
the
first
to
be
deployed
with
real-world
autonomous
vehicles.
Its
rising
star
is
the
TractEasy
fully
electric
autonomous
tow-tractor.
It
allows
24/7
ground
transportation
of
goods
on
industrial
sites
and
logistics
centres.
It
optimizes
supply
chains
with
the
new
and
highly-automated
innovation
of
being
able
to 
cross
from
indoors
to
complex,
outdoor
environments,
unlike
existing
automated
guided
vehicles
(AGVs).
EasyMile
is
also
working
on
other
heavy-duty
vehicle
applications
including
buses,
trams
and
trucks.
My
team
is
in
charge
of
this
program
and
I
would
say
that
working
on
EasyMile’s
future
AV
vehicles
is
really
challenging
and
motivating
!
With
more
than
250
deployments
in
over
30
countries,
EasyMile’s
technology
has
powered
600,000km
of
autonomous
driving
to
date.
&nbsp;
What
are
some
of
the
different
cities
or
municipalities
that
you
are
currently
working
with?
In
the
USA,
our
EZ10s
are
involved
in
demonstration
projects
in
16
American
cities,
carrying
tens
of
thousands
of
passengers.
Most
of
these
are
by
organizations
like
Departments
of
Transportation,
airports,
universities
and
transit
agencies
in
collaboration
with
US-based
EasyMile
Inc.
We
have
a
very
strong
presence
in
Germany
and
France
as
well
as
other
projects
around
Europe.
These
include
business
parks,
hospitals,
universities,
cities
and
towns,
and
communities.
In
Australia
they
have
a
focus
on
shared
mobility
with
recent
projects
including
a
retirement
village
and
connecting
a
ferry
service
to
the
centre
of
a
small
island.
We
are
also
working
on
a
number
of
projects
in
Asia.
&nbsp;
Is
there
anything
else
that
you
would
like
to
share
about
EasyMile?
It
was
such
a
wonderful
opportunity
for
me
because
at
the
time
when
I
was
looking
for
an
opportunity
in
this
area
the
industry
was
still
in
its
infancy.
I
love
that
EasyMile
is
serious
&#8211;
we
are
really
industrialising
our
products
and
services
and
this
is
still
quite
unique
in
this
space.
We’re
not
just
playing
in
a
garage
with
robots,
we’re
delivering
real,
measurable,
services
that
deliver
tangible
benefits
and
outcomes
for
our
clients.
Thank
you
for
the
fantastic
interview
I
really
enjoyed
learning
more
about
EasyMile,
easily
one
of
the
most
underrated
startups
in
the
autonomous
vehicles
space.
