Tobias
Rijken
is
the
Co-Founder
&amp;
CTO
at
Kheiron
Medical
Technologies
,
a
medical
imaging
company
that
uses
advanced
machine
learning
technologies
to
develop
and
provide
intelligent
tools
for
radiologists,
radiology
departments,
imaging
centers
and
hospitals
to
improve
efficiency,
consistency
and
accuracy
of
radiology
reporting.
Kheiron
Medical
Technologies
was
founded
with
the
sole
focus
of
helping
radiologists
detect
breast
cancer
earlier
with
machine
learning
software.
What
initially
attracted
you
to
machine
learning?
My
informal
introduction
to
machine
learning
was
when
I
first
started
learning
programming
when
I
was
a
young
teenager.
There
was
this
games
engine
where
you
could
program
your
own
games.
I
wanted
to
play
this
game,
but
who
do
I
play
against?
It
could
be
another
player,
but
it
could
also
be
a
program.
How
do
you
build
a
program
that
learns
how
to
play
a
game?
It
wasn’t
a
modern
AI,
it
was
rule-based
AI.
I
beat
it
every
time,
so
it
was
not
a
good
AI.
When
I
was
studying
for
my
master’s
degree
at
University
College
London,
we
entered
a
new
era
of
modern
AI.
DeepMind
had
just
been
acquired,
and
I
was
studying
machine
learning
at
the
place
where
DeepMind
was
actually
founded.
David
Silver,
one
of
the
leading
scientists
of
DeepMind,
was
teaching
a
course
on
reinforcement
learning
.
As
part
of
the
course,
I
built
an
agent
to
learn
how
to
play
a
game
&#8211;
a
simplified
form
of
blackjack.
When
I
finished
the
AI
and
played
against
my
own
creation,
I
couldn&#8217;t
beat
it
anymore.
And
that
was
a
real
revelation.
My
formal
introduction
to
machine
learning
came
in
my
first
year
of
university.
I
was
studying
math
and
computer
science
at
Amsterdam
University
College.
At
the
same
time,
massive
new
open
online
courses
were
established
and
I
could
join
AI
courses
from
leading
figures
in
the
field.
The
course
that
made
the
biggest
impact
was
with
Peter
Norvig
and
Sebastian
Thrun
from
Stanford,
and
I
could
study
AI
with
100,000
people
at
the
same
time.
Now
with
Kheiron,
what
I
like
so
much
about
machine
learning
is
the
application
it
has
on
the
real
world.
The
opportunity
it
has
to
solve
real
world
problems.
That’s
what
really
excites
me.
Could
you
discuss
the
genesis
story
behind
Kheiron
Medical?
Peter
and
I
met
in
2016
at
the
UK
accelerator
Entrepreneur
First.
We
connected
straight
away
&#8211;
probably
because
of
our
similar
backgrounds.
We
both
come
from
medical
families
&#8211;
Peter’s
mother
is
a
radiologist,
I
grew
up
in
a
medical
family,
surrounded
by
doctors,
and
both
of
us
chose
to
go
down
the
STEM
route.
Our
backgrounds
gave
us
a
clear
view
of
the
struggles
and
challenges
that
healthcare
workers
face
and
an
understanding
of
how
AI
can
improve
their
lives
as
well
as
the
lives
of
patients.
We
share
a
belief
that
AI
together
with
clinicians
will
change
healthcare
for
the
better.
There’s
a
big
problem
to
be
solved
here.
There’s
a
global
shortage
of
radiologists.
A
lot
of
people
die
from
cancer
&#8211;
more
than
40,000
American
women
die
every
year
from
breast
cancer.
Part
of
the
reason
so
many
people
die
from
cancer
is
that
doctors
don’t
have
the
right
information
to
make
the
right
decisions.
AI
can
help
with
that.
First
and
foremost,
Kheiron
is
here
to
help
the
radiologist
so
the
radiologist
can
help
the
patients.
I
personally
get
very
motivated
by
digging
into
the
problem
to
understand
its
intricacies.
We
all
work
hard
to
really
understand
the
radiologists’
work,
the
data
they
are
working
with
on
a
daily
basis,
their
workflow.
Then
we
can
figure
out
how
we
can
deploy
AI
as
part
of
this
workflow.
We
invest
heavily
in
deeply
understanding
the
users
and
the
data.
We
have
radiologists
on
our
team
who
help
us
integrate
the
user
needs
into
the
design
and
development
process.
We
have
a
patient
involvement
initiative
that
engages
directly
with
women
to
understand
their
fears
and
needs
for
breast
screening.
Many
people
ask
me
about
the
name
of
our
company
&#8211;
Kheiron.
Kheiron
was
a
wise,
gentle
centaur
&#8211; 
a
creature
that
is
part
man,
part
horse
in
Greek
mythology
&#8211;
who
trained
the
heroes
in
medicine.
This
idea
of
two
halves
making
up
something
more
powerful
than
the
individual
parts
is
the
inspiration
for
Kheiron
&#8211;
AI
and
the
clinician
working
together
to
change
what’s
possible
in
the
standard
of
care.
Can
you
discuss
the
breast
cancer
screening
solutions
that
are
offered?
We’re
working
on
several
breast
cancer
solutions
along
the
breast
cancer
screening
pathway.
Our
first
product
is
called
Mia™
&#8211;
which
stands
for
mammography
intelligent
assessment.
Mia
has
been
optimised
to
perform
the
same
task
as
radiologist
&#8211;
namely,
to
determine
whether
the
woman
should
be
called
back
for
further
examination
or
not.
The
level
of
performance
we’re
achieving
allows
us
to
rethink
the
workflow.
For
American
women,
this
is
incredibly
meaningful.
The
U.S.
has
what
is
called
a
“single-reader
workflow”.
This
means
that
each
mammogram
is
read
by
one
radiologist.
However,
the
U.K.
and
Europe
have
a
“double-reader
workflow”,
meaning
that
every
mammogram
is
read
by
two
radiologists.
Many
American
radiologists
consider
double
reading
to
be
the
“gold
standard”
because
it
is
more
likely
than
a
single
reader
to
detect
early,
small
breast
cancers.
Our
clinical
studies
prove
that
Mia
is
a
clinically
safe
and
cost-effective
option
as
an
independent
or
concurrent
reader.
This
means
that
in
the
U.S.,
Mia
can
be
used
together
with
the
radiologist
to
achieve
that
gold
standard
of
a
double-reading
workflow
&#8211;
with
a
single
human
reader.
Like
I
said
earlier,
this
is
truly
how
we
see
the
power
of
AI
and
the
human
coming
together
to
solve
big
problems.
The
first
product
we’re
bringing
to
the
U.S.
market
is
called
Mia
IQ™,
which
sits
one
step
earlier
in
the
breast
cancer
screening
pathway.
Mia
IQ
helps
the
radiography
technicians
analyze
the
quality
of
the
image.
If
we
can
improve
the
quality
of
the
image,
then
the
quality
of
the
reading
will
also
go
up.
And
this
means
that
more
cancers
will
be
detected
sooner,
when
the
outcomes
can
be
better
for
the
woman.
This
is
very
important
for
MQSA
quality
assurance
audits
and
for
continuous
training,
which
is
where
we
expect
to
see
Mia
IQ’s
first
applications.
Mia
IQ
provides
screening
programs
with
reports
detailing
positioning
problems.
This
will
allow
the
program
directors
to
provide
spot
training
for
techs
and
address
any
broader
image
quality
problems
that
may
affect
their
quality
assurance
audits.
How
many
images
has
the
neural
network
been
trained
on?
For
us,
the
quantity
of
data
is
not
the
point.
The
good
thing
about
breast
cancer
screening
space
is
there’s
a
lot
of
data
available.
There’s
a
lot
of
historical
data
because
screening
programs
have
been
around
for
quite
a
while.
And
because
you
screen
an
entire
population,
there’s
a
lot
of
new
data
being
generated.
The
challenge
is
that
the
data
is
heavily
skewed.
99%
of
the
screening
population
doesn’t
have
cancer,
luckily,
which
means
there’s
a
skew
toward
normal
images.
There
are
also
population
differences,
with
a
lack
of
diversity
in
the
data.
So
for
Kheiron,
the
challenge
isn’t
about
getting
the
quantity
of
data.
Instead,
where
a
large
part
of
our
success
comes
from
is
understanding
which
data
to
collect
to
get
the
best
results,
and
to
be
very
selective
and
targeted
in
where
and
how
we
get
our
data.
Our
collaboration
with
Emory
University
is
a
great
example
of
how
we’re
doing
this.
Are
false
positives
currently
an
issue?
False
positives
are
only
part
of
the
issue.
The
science
of
screening
relies
on
tradeoffs
between
false
positives
and
false
negatives.
For
instance,
we
can
achieve
a
very
low
false
positive
rate,
but
we
will
miss
some
cancers.
On
the
other
hand,
we
can
have
very
few
missed
cancers
if
we
have
a
high
false
positive
rate.
It’s
important
to
understand
those
trade-offs
and
to
balance
your
screening
service
based
on
priorities
and
resources.
Cultural
and
policy
differences
also
exist
between
countries,
which
influence
the
way
these
tradeoffs
are
made.
In
some
countries,
missing
a
cancer
is
considered
very
problematic.
In
other
countries,
it’s
seen
to
be
more
important
to
minimize
unnecessary
recalls
because
of
the
healthcare
cost
associated
with
each
recall.
Ultimately,
it’s
about
understanding
how
this
tradeoff
impacts
patients,
in
terms
of
the
number
of
unnecessary
recalls
and
further
tests
experienced
by
the
‘false
positive’
group
versus
the
‘false
negative’
group
whose
cancers
go
undetected.
It’s
a
difficult
balancing
act,
but
AI
promises
to
raise
the
bar
for
both
groups.
Kheiron
Medical
Technologies
and
Emory
University
recently
announced
a
collaboration
to
evaluate
data
from
prior
mammograms
on
over
50,000
African
American
women
who
have
been
screened
at
Emory
Healthcare.
Could
you
share
more
details
about
this
project?
Our
partnership
with
Emory
University
broadens
the
diversity
of
data
we
are
using
to
ensure
Mia,
our
AI
breast
cancer
screening
solution,
works
to
the
same
standard
for
any
woman,
regardless
of
ethnicity.
The
first
project
in
the
collaboration
will
support
the
validation
of
Mia’s
performance
against
Emory’s
diverse
screening
population.
This
is
a
multi-site
study
spanning
four
screening
sites
and
hospitals.
A
cohort
of
more
than
200,000
screening
mammograms
will
be
included
in
this
project
&#8211;
approximately
45%
of
women
in
that
cohort
are
of
African
American
descent.
We
announced
this
collaboration
in
late
November
and
have
made
great
progress
since
then,
even
considering
the
challenges
of
operating
under
a
global
pandemic
and
remote
working
conditions.
I
think
that
is
a
huge
credit
to
the
team
at
Emory,
who
are
also
clinicians
providing
excellent
care
to
patients
in
the
community.
Right
now
our
collaboration
is
investing
the
upfront
energy
to
establish
a
strong
foundation
for
our
future
work.
We’re
at
a
stage
where
we’re
working
closely
with
the
Emory
team
to
understand
clinical
workflows.
This
serves
as
the
necessary
foundation
for
deep
analysis
and
interrogation
of
potential
differences
between
subpopulations,
like
ethnic
groups.
This
work
is
not
easy
or
fast.
Not
many
things
in
healthcare
are.
However,
it
is
very
rewarding,
and
we’re
lucky
to
benefit
from
a
set
of
global
partners
who
are
extremely
collaborative
and
aligned
with
us
on
our
shared
mission:
to
help
any
woman
anywhere
have
a
fighting
chance
against
breast
cancer.
How
large
of
an
issue
is
the
under-representation
of
non-whites
for
image
data
for
cancer
diagnosis?
Historically,
the
diversity
of
patient
populations
has
not
been
mirrored
in
medical
research
to
the
extent
that
it
should
be.
Those
of
us
developing
AI
have
a
responsibility
to
include
ethnic
diversity
in
our
studies.
Under-represented
populations
are
an
issue
for
breast
cancer
screening.
Outcomes
for
African
American
women
are
an
example
of
this.
African
American
women
tend
to
have
higher
mortality
rates
(39%
higher
than
non-Hispanic
whites),
and
this
may
be
attributed
to
access
to
health
care,
delays
in
diagnosis,
and
delays
in
treatment
initiation,
among
other
factors.
Generalizability
of
AI
across
various
populations
is
a
key
step
toward
addressing
racial
disparities
in
breast
screening.
I’m
excited
that
our
Kheiron
team
is
committed
to
building
a
solution
that
performs
equally
well
on
mammograms
from
racially
diverse
populations
&#8211;
and
this
is
a
big
motivating
factor
for
our
work.
Our
collaboration
with
Emory
and
UCSF
will
help
us
achieve
this
vision
of
generalizability
&#8211;
making
sure
that
Mia
gives
every
woman,
everywhere
a
better
fighting
chance
against
breast
cancer.
Thank
you

great
interview
and
for
working
on
such
important
life
saving
technologies.
