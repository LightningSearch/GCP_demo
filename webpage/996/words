Clinc’s
Conversational
AI
Delivers
Unparalleled
Customer
Engagement
For
Banks
Customer
engagement.
It’s
what
every
bank
is
prioritizing
in
2017.
In
KPMG’s
report 
“Banking
Outlook:
An
Industry
at
a
Pivot
Point.”
,
they
highlight
the
importance
of
connecting
with
customers
in
today’s
climate:
“In
our
view,
few
mandates
are
more
important
to
the
banking
industry
right
now
than
a
relentless
attention
to
connecting
with
customers
as
a
means
of
building
new
revenue
streams.”
So
in
order
to
drive
customer
engagement,
one
must
look
at
what
customers
want.
Multiple
studies
show
the
same
essential
characteristics
that
customers
desperately
want
from
their
banks:
Clinc&#8217;s
Conversational
AI
Clinc’s
conversational
AI
delivers
in
spades
on
every
one
of
these
desires.
When
FI’s
integrate
our
technology,
their
customers
can
ask
any
question,
worded
any
way
they
want,
and
our
technology
will
not
only
understand,
it
will
provide
them
with
instant
access
to
extraordinary
financial
insights.

No
Rules,
Just
Talk
Unlike
chatbots
and
rule-based
offerings,
Clinc
doesn’t
force
its
users
to
speak
in
certain
ways.
No
rules,
just
talk
naturally.
No
more
thinking
about
how
to
word
a
question
in
order
to
be
understood.
We
erase
the
challenge
of
“What
should
I
say?”
from
customers’
minds.
Understanding
complicated
requests
is
only
half
of
the
puzzle.
Clinc’s
cutting-edge
technology
analyzes
the
user’s
financial
information
and
responds
with
remarkably
intuitive
answers.
No
other
conversational
AI
on
the
market
makes
its
users
feel
so
understood.
The
Clinc
team
is
beyond
excited
to
be
building
the
next
generation
of
conversational
AI.
We’re
passionate
about
challenging
the
status
quo
and
making
the
best
possible
product
we
can.
