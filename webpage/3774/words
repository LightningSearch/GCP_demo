and

WIFT
remains
a
mission
critical
channel
for
all
financial
institutions.
But
the
cost
and
complexity
of
operating
SWIFT
for
top-tier
banks
has
increased
substantially
since
the
introduction
of
SWIFT’s
CSP
programme.
As
payments
and
connectivity
become
increasingly
commoditised
for
all
financial
institutions,
banks
are
re-thinking
how
best
to
maintain
secure,
reliable
and
compliant
SWIFT
operations
and
back-office
applications
at
the
lowest
cost.
To
respond
to
our
customers’
needs,
equensWorldline
has
launched
a
new
fully
managed
service
to
meet
the
needs
of
tier-1
banks
that
can
no
longer
afford
to
invest
in
ageing
infrastructure
or
meet
increasingly
stringent
regulations
and
market
practices.
Now,
for
the
first
time,
outsourcing
of
SWIFT
and
other
financial
messaging
channels
is
a
realistic
and
attractive
option
for
tier-1
banks
that
previously
operated
their
SWIFT
infrastructures
in-house.
Commerzbank
AG,
a
top
SWIFT
user,
recognised
the
benefits
and
adopted
the
Next
Generation
Financial
Messaging
service
from
Worldline,
an
Atos
Group
Company.
The
service
uses
the
BOX
Messaging
Hub
from
Intercope.
The
webinar
will
give
an
overview
of
the:
Fundamental
changes
to
SWIFT
operations
impacting
Tier-1
banks
Changes
to
the
regulatory
environment
including
SWIFT’s
CSP
programme
The
key
financial
benefits
of
 using
this
managed
service
Key
benefits
of
a
modern
and
high
performance
platform
Flexible
customization
to
customer
needs
Ease
of
integration
to
back-end
applications
