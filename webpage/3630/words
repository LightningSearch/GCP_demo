In
the
biggest
fundraising
for
an
identity
verification
company
to
date,
Jumio
has
locked
in
an
investment
of
$150
million
.
The
funding
comes
courtesy
of
Great
Hill
Partners,
a
private
equity
firm
that
specializes
in
investments
in
&#8220;high-growth,
disruptive
companies.&#8221;
The
investment
takes
Jumio&#8217;s
total
funding
to
more
than
$255
million,
according
to
Crunchbase.
&#8220;Jumio&#8217;s
innovations
helped
establish
the
identity
verification
market,
and
the
need
to
establish
someone&#8217;s
digital
identity
remotely
has
never
been
greater,&#8221;
Jumio
CEO
Robert
Prigge
said.
The
company
plans
to
use
the
new
capital
to
automate
its
identity
verification
solutions,
expand
the
breadth
of
its
Jumio
KYX
Platform
,
and
further
build
out
the
platform&#8217;s
suite
of
AML
compliance
solutions.
As
part
of
the
investment,
Great
Hill
Partners&#8217;
Nick
Cayer
and
Matt
Vettel
will
join
Jumio&#8217;s
Board
of
Directors.
Cayer,
who
has
been
with
Great
Hill
since
2006,
praised
the
company
as
&#8220;the
de
factor
global
leader
in
online
identity
verification,
fraud
detection,
and
compliance.&#8221;
He
added
that
given
the
mandate
many
institutions
have
to
digitize
processes
such
as
onboarding
and
KYC
monitoring,
firms
like
Jumio
can
play
a
key
role
in
helping
them
keep
pace
with
the
growing
volume
of
digital
and
mobile-based
transactions.
Making
its
Finovate
debut
in
2013
and
being
acquired
by
Centana
Growth
Partners
in
2016,
Jumio
has
verified
more
than
300
million
identities
issued
by
200+
countries
and
territories
since
inception
in
2010.
With
customers
and
partners
in
a
wide
range
of
verticals
&#8211;
from
financial
services
and
the
sharing
economy
to
retail,
travel,
and
online
gaming
&#8211;
Jumio
leverages
AI,
biometrics,
machine
learning,
and
certified
liveness
detection
to
help
ensure
that
customers
are
who
they
claim
to
be.
Jumio&#8217;s
KYX
Platform,
launched
last
fall
,
provides
organizations
with
an
end-to-end
identity
verification
and
eKYC
solution
that
enables
them
to
onboard
new
accounts
safely
and
accurately,
keep
existing
accounts
secure,
and
meet
their
compliance
obligations
with
regards
to
KYC,
AML,
and
GDPR.
&#8220;Digital
transformation
is
more
than
a
buzzword.
It&#8217;s
today&#8217;s
business
imperative,&#8221;
Prigge
said.
&#8220;To
succeed,
organizations
must
transform
quickly
and
do
it
in
ways
that
build
trust,
security,
and
satisfaction.
Businesses
can
tailor
the
Jumio
KYX
Platform
to
fit
their
unique
needs
and
risks
and
tap
into
services
that
accelerate
digital
transformation
without
sacrificing
security
and
convenience.&#8221;

New

Highlight:
MainStreet

Here
in
the
U.S.,
it&#8217;s
tax
season.
And
even
though
the
IRS
has
extended
the
filing
deadline
by
a
few
weeks,
it&#8217;s
still
a
stressful
time
for
both
individuals
and
businesses.
In
an
era
of
changing
benefits,
everyone
is
on
the
lookout
to
minimize
their
tax
burden.
Enter
MainStreet
,
a
company
founded
in
2019
that
helps
qualify
tech
startups
for
tax
credits
that
most
accountants
don&#8217;t
check
for.
The
California-based
company
works
with
startups&#8217;
accountants
to
check
for
more
than
200
potential
unclaimed
tax
credits.
MainStreet
works
by
integrating
the
startups&#8217;
payroll
and
scanning
the
data
on
a
monthly
basis
for
potential
federal,
state,
and
local
tax
credits.
If
MainStreet
finds
a
tax
credit,
the
company
will
advance
80%
of
the
credit
amount
to
the
startup
so
that
they
can
use
the
funds
right
away
instead
of
waiting
on
their
tax
refund.
The
client
is
responsible
for
repaying
that
amount,
with
no
interest
incurred,
after
they
receive
their
credit
from
the
government.
MainStreet
does
not
charge
a
fee
for
this
monthly
service.
Instead,
the
company
keeps
the
remaining
20%
of
the
startups&#8217;
tax
credit
amount.
However,
MainStreet
only
receives
payment
if
it
successfully
finds
a
refund
for
the
client.
In
the
event
of
an
audit,
MainStreet
offers
support
through
the
auditing
process.
And
if
MainStreet
makes
an
error
with
the
paperwork
or
credit
claim,
the
client
is
insured
for
up
to
$1
million.
So
far,
MainStreet
has
found
more
than
$80
million
for
over
1,000
startups.
The
company&#8217;s
clients
include
Rally,
Newfront
Insurance,
LedgerX,
Pave,
and
more.
In
the
long
term,
MainStreet
plans
to
expand
its
operations
beyond
serving
tech
startups
to
include
small
businesses,
as
well.
MainStreet
has
received
almost
$63
million
from
investors
including
Gradient
Ventures,
Sound
Ventures,
and
Signal
Fire.

Raises
$133
Million
By

Anybody
else
old
enough
to
remember
the
argument
that
while
blockchain
technology
probably
had
value,
actual
cryptocurrencies
were
already
passé?
In
a
round
led
by
Coatue,
Ribbit,
and
Stripes,
digital
asset
infrastructure
specialist
Fireblocks
has
secured
$133
million
in
new
capital
to
power
its
mission
to
make
it
easier
for
banks
to
get
into
the
digital
asset
space.
&#8220;Fintechs
and
banks
require
not
only
a
specialized
custody
and
settlement
infrastructure
to
ensure
customer
funds
are
safely
managed,
but
(also)
a
platform
that
enables
new
lines
of
digital
offerings,&#8221;
Fireblocks
CEO
Michael
Shaulov
said.
He
noted
that
while
the
company
has
no
plans
to
become
an
actual
bank
itself,
&#8220;we
believe
our
infrastructure
will
lend
itself
perfectly
to
power
an
entirely
new
era
of
financial
services.&#8221;
Also
participating
in
the
round
as
strategic
investors
were
The
Bank
of
New
York
Mellon
and
SVB.
A
number
of
Fireblocks
existing
investors
also
contributed
to
the
round,
including
Paradigm,
Galaxy
Digital,
Swisscom
Ventures,
Tenaya
Capital
and
Cyberstarts
Ventures.
The
investment
brings
the
fintech&#8217;s
total
capital
raised
to
$179
million.
Founded
in
2018,
Fireblocks
launched
as
a
digital
assets
infrastructure
company
helping
crypto-based
institutions
and
exchanges
move,
store,
and
issue
digital
assets.
As
interest
in
digital
assets
&#8211;
especially
cryptocurrencies
like
Bitcoin
and
Ethereum
&#8211;
has
surged,
Fireblocks
has
begun
to
leverage
its
talent
and
technology
in
digital
assets
to
enable
banks
and
other
financial
institutions
to
bring
cryptocurrency
access
to
their
customers.
By
linking
to
its
Fireblocks&#8217;
platform,
banks
and
fintechs
will
be
able
to
deploy
a
wide
range
of
solutions
&#8211;
from
custody,
tokenization,
and
asset
management
to
trading,
lending,
and
payments
&#8211;
on
both
public
and
private
blockchain
networks.
The
company&#8217;s
investors
highlighted
Fireblocks&#8217;
capacity
to
enable
banks
and
other
financial
institutions
to
efficiently
and
securely
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
of
and
interest
in
digital
assets.
CEO
of
Asset
Servicing
and
Head
of
Digital
for
BNY
Mellon
Roman
Regelman
said
that
bridging
the
gap
between
traditional
and
digital
assets
is
&#8220;foundational
to
the
future
of
custody.&#8221;
Coatue
Managing
Partner
Kris
Fredrickson
concurred:
&#8220;our
belief
(is)
that
a
new
financial
ecosystem
is
emerging
and
(companies)
like
Fireblocks
are
essential.&#8221;
Last
month,
Fireblocks
announced
a
partnership
with
digital
payment-
platform-as-a-service
company,
First.
Together,
the
companies
introduced
a
secure
wallet
and
infrastructure
solution
to
enable
financial
institutions
to
facilitate
transactions
via
the
Diem
network
.
Fireblocks
began
the
year
collaborating
with
global
fintech
Ibanera
to
help
its
customers
safely
transfer
crypto
funds
in
real-time
.
Since
inception,
Fireblocks
has
secured
the
transfer
of
more
than
$400
billion
in
digital
assets.
The
company
is
headquartered
in
New
York
City.

Peer-to-peer
lending
platform
and
digital
bank
Zopa
landed
some
extra
funds
this
week,
now
that
its
new
banking
platform
is
starting
to
take
off.
The
U.K.-based
company
pulled
in
$28
million
(£20
million)
from
existing
investors,
bringing
its
total
raised
to
$465
million.
Investors
in
today&#8217;s
round
include
IAG
Silverstripe,
which
led
the
round,
as
well
as
Augmentum,
Alternative
Credit
Investments,
Venture
Founders,
and
others.
The
company
will
use
the
funds
to
support
the
growth
of
its
digital
bank.
Zopa
secured
its
banking
license
last
June
and
has
since
transitioned
its
platform
from
a
peer-to-peer
lending
operation
to
a
digital
bank
with
a
peer-to-peer
lending
option.
Since
that
time,
Zopa
began
offering
savings
accounts,
which
have
reached
$346
million
(£250
million)
in
customer
deposits,
and
a
credit
card
product
that
has
made
Zopa
a
top
10
credit
card
issuer
in
the
U.K.
based
on
new
customers.
The
new
funding
comes
at
a
time
when
competition
among
digital
banks
is
at
an
all-time
high.
Zopa
is
poised
to
do
well
in
the
battle
for
new
clients
and
deposits,
however.
The
company
has
built
a
well-established
client
base,
resources,
and
relationships
since
it
was
founded
in
2004
as
a
peer-to-peer
lending
platform.
Zopa
CEO
Jaidev
Janardana
echoes
this.
&#8220;Less
than
a
year
since
launching
our
bank,
we
have
exceeded
our
plan
for
growth,
both
in
terms
of
customers
and
balance
sheet,&#8221;
he
said.
&#8220;This
capital
injection
will
enable
us
to
continue
on
this
accelerated
path.
Our
strong
entry
to
the
U.K.
savings
and
credit
card
markets
shows
the
organic
appeal
of
our
products
and
we
are
happy
to
have
investors
who
share
our
excitement
at
the
opportunity
to
serve
more
customers
across
more
product
categories.&#8221;

Still
looking
for
evidence
that
cryptocurrencies
have
arrived?
The
$170
million
raised
this
week
by
Austrian
digital
asset
neobroker
Bitpanda
is
a
testament
to
both
the
surging
interest
in
cryptocurrencies
as
well
as
the
vitality
of
fintech
innovation
in
the
CEE
countries.
Bitpanda&#8217;s
Series
B
round
earned
the
company
a
valuation
of
$1.2
billion,
giving
Austria
its
first
fintech
unicorn
.
The
Vienna-based
company,
founded
in
2014
by
co-CEOs
Eric
Demuth
and
Paul
Klanschek,
along
with
CTO
Christian
Trummer,
plans
to
use
the
capital
to
add
to
the
types
of
investments
available
on
its
platform,
as
well
as
expand
to
more
markets
in
Europe.
This
latest
funding
round
was
led
by
Valar
Ventures
and
featured
participation
from
DST
Global.
The
round
is
more
than
triple
the
amount
raised
by
Bitpanda
in
its
Series
A
financing
back
in
September,
which
was
also
led
by
Valar
Ventures
(SpeedInvest
of
Vienna
was
an
investor
in
the
round,
as
well).
The
capital
arrives
the
same
week
that
Bitpanda
announced
that
it
had
reached
a
new
milestone
of
more
than
two
million
registered
users
on
its
Bitpanda
and
Bitpanda
Pro
platforms.
Bitpanda
enables
cryptocurrency
investors
and
traders
to
buy,
sell,
save,
and
send
more
than
50
digital
assets
including
Bitcoin
and
Ethereum.
The
neobroker
also
offers
the
world&#8217;s
first
real
crypto
index
and
a
Bitpanda
Card
that
enables
Bitpanda
accountholders
to
spend
their
digital
assets
as
easily
as
they
spend
their
cash.
With
FinovateEurope
right
around
the
corner
,
we&#8217;ve
got
more
than
a
little
continental
fintech
on
the
mind
these
days.
This
week
we
take
a
quick
look
at
fintech
news
from
France,
a
country
whose
fintech
industry
is
often
overlooked
in
the
broader
conversation
on
European
fintech.
Earlier
this
week,
we
learned
that
Finovate
alum
Ledger
was
launching
a
new
business
division
dedicated
to
taking
advantage
of
growing
institutional
interest
in
cryptocurrencies
.
Headquartered
in
Paris
and
founded
in
2013,
the
company
announced
that
its
Ledger
Enterprise
Solutions
unit
will
support
enterprise
adoption
of
the
company&#8217;s
core
custody
technology
,
Ledger
Vault
,
as
well
as
advise
institutional
clients
with
regards
to
technology
implementation,
security,
and
governance
of
digital
asset
portfolios.
On
the
French
fintech
funding
beat,
PayFit,
a
payroll
and
HR
platform
launched
in
France
in
2016,
announced
that
it
has
secured
$107
million
(EUR
90
million)
in
Series
D
funding.
The
investment
was
led
by
Eurzeo
Growth,
Large
Venture,
and
BPI
France,
and
featured
participation
from
the
company&#8217;s
existing
investors
Accel,
Frst,
and
individual
investor
Xavier
Niel.
The
company
said
that
the
capital
will
help
support
its
comprehensive
HR
solution
for
SMEs
and
enable
the
company
&#8211;
which
also
operates
in
Spain,
Germany,
the
U.K.,
and
Italy
&#8211;
to
&#8220;increase
headcount
from
550
to
800&#8221;
by
the
end
of
2021.
PayFit
serves
more
than
5,000
small
businesses,
and
includes
Revolut
,
Starling
Bank,
and
Treatwell
among
its
customers.
The
company
experienced
growth
of
40%
in
2020
&#8211;
a
pace
PayFit
anticipates
doubling
this
year
&#8211;
and
credited
much
of
this
&#8220;hypergrowth&#8221;
to
the
digital
imperative
brought
on
by
the
COVID-19
crisis.
&#8220;As
a
result
of
the
pandemic,
HR
professionals
have
faced
a
much
higher
workload
and
unfamiliar
challenges,&#8221;
PayFit
co-founder
and
CEO
Firmin
Zocchetto
said
.
&#8220;They
have
had
to
deal
with
various
issues,
including
supporting
the
company&#8217;s
management
with
the
implementation
of
remote
work
policies
and
ensuring
employee
wellbeing
through
new
initiatives.&#8221;
Zocchetto
said
that
there
are
&#8220;tens
of
millions
of
SMEs&#8221;
that
are
ready
for
digital
transformation.
&#8220;The
market
is
huge,
and
our
ambition
remains
the
same:
to
become
the
point
of
reference
for
payroll
and
HR
management
for
all
SMEs,&#8221;
he
said.
Striking
another
note
in
the
funding
beat,
French
fintech
Silvr
announced
a
EUR
3
million
seed
investment
this
week
.
The
company,
launched
last
year
by
Nima
Karimi
and
Gregory
Tappero,
provides
financing
for
digital
businesses
that
cannot
access
traditional
bank
financing
and
want
to
raise
equity
capital.
Silvr
offers
a
revenue-based
financing
model
based
on
the
performance
of
the
financed
company,
an
approach
that
contrasts
with
both
traditional
asset-based
lending
and
fundraising
models.
Karimi
has
said
that
Silvr&#8217;s
strategy
offers
a
new
option
for
SMEs
in
France,
calling
it
simpler
and
more
transparent.

Phone-based
fraud
prevention
company
Pindrop
acquired
Next
Caller
this
week.
Terms
of
the
deal
were
undisclosed.
Pindrop
anticipates
the
purchase
of
NextCaller,
a
call
verification
and
fraud
detection
solution
for
contact
centers,
will
position
the
company
for
growth,
expand
its
client
base,
and
position
it
as
an
industry
leader.
&#8220;Our
two
companies
will
now
be
able
to
service
the
market
in
its
entirety
with
the
right
solution
for
whatever
stage
of
voice
security
and
authentication
they
are
in,&#8221;
said
Next
Caller
Co-founder
and
CEO
Ian
Roncoroni.
The
deal
comes
at
a
time
when
demand
for
call
centers
is
expanding.
In
a
recent
report,
Forrester
found
that
42%
of
brands
surveyed
saw
an
increase
in
year-over-year
call
center
call
volume
since
the
pandemic
began.
Additionally,
65%
of
companies
reported
they
struggle
to
manage
the
high
call
volume
and
80%
of
firms
reported
that
fraud
is
a
very
serious
issue
in
the
call
center.
Given
this,
Pindrop
CEO
Vijay
Balasubramaniyan
has
a
positive
outlook
for
the
fraud
prevention
industry.
&#8220;We
couldn’t
be
more
bullish
about
the
future,&#8221;
he
said,
&#8220;The
need
for
our
combined
solutions
will
only
continue
to
grow
as
brands
across
multiple
industries
not
only
look
to
better
secure
their
voice
channel,
but
also
improve
the
customer
experience.
Understanding
who
you
are
speaking
to
is
the
most
effective
way
to
build
a
better
relationship
with
customers,
resulting
in
a
higher
NPS
and
subsequently
more
profitable
exchanges.&#8221;
As
for
what&#8217;s
next,
Next
Caller
will
operate
as
a
wholly-owned
subsidiary
under
Pindrop.
Founded
in
2011,
Pindrop
debuted
an
IVR
solution
as
well
as
the
availability
of
its
voice
authentication
technology
for
use
in
OTT
streaming
devices.
Headquartered
in
Alabama,
Pindrop
is
privately
held
and
has
raised
a
total
of
$213
million
from
investors
including
Andreessen
Horowitz
and
Citi
Ventures.

NYMBUS

NYMBUS
<!--<div

Financial
services
platform
NYMBUS
has
selected
the
cloud
platform
from
open
source
solution
provider
Red
Hat
for
its
digital
banking
ecosystem.
The
platform,
Red
Hat
OpenShift
,
will
enable
Nymbus
to
help
its
community
bank
and
credit
union
customers
accelerate
their
digital
transformations
.
&#8220;The
COVID-19
pandemic
has
changed
the
way
we
bank,
possibly
forever,&#8221;
Nymbus
CEO
Jeffery
Kendall
said.
&#8220;It
provided
the
push
for
local
banks
and
credit
unions
to
establish
more
secure,
flexible,
end-to-end
digital
banking
solutions.&#8221;
Kendall
added
that
the
partnership
with
Red
Hat
would
give
Nymbus&#8217;
partners
more
&#8220;freedom
of
choice&#8221;
in
the
way
they
implemented
their
cloud
banking
strategies
as
well
as
the
&#8220;multi-cloud
uptime&#8221;
Kendall
said
was
&#8220;critical
for
the
banking
industry.&#8221;
Courtesy
of
the
new
partnership,
Nymbus
customers
will
be
able
to
deploy
and
launch
a
turnkey,
digital
bank-in-a-box
&#8211;
running
on
OpenShift
&#8211;
on
whatever
cloud
platform
they
prefer.
The
open
source,
cloud-agnostic
nature
of
Red
Hat&#8217;s
solution
helps
institutions
avoid
being
dependent
on
a
sole
vendor,
which
can
impede
innovation.
&#8220;Cloud
technology
is
reshaping
the
way
banking
services
are
created
and
delivered
in
our
digital
world,&#8221;
Red
Hat
VP
and
Global
Head
of
Financial
Services
Richard
Harmon
said.
&#8220;It
is
providing
service
providers
the
ability
to
quickly
adapt
to
market
changes
and
make
it
easier
for
community
banks
and
credit
unions
to
consume
new
software.
We
are
excited
to
work
with
Nymbus
to
bring
the
innovation
of
open
source
and
cloud
technology
to
the
market.
Nymbus
truly
embraces
the
open
source
way
of
working,
and
we
are
looking
forward
to
contributing
to
their
success.&#8221;
Founded
in
2015
and
headquartered
in
Miami
Beach,
Florida,
Nymbus
most
recently
demonstrated
its
technology
on
the
Finovate
stage
in
2019
as
part
of
FinovateFall.
The
company
began
this
year
with
a
pair
of
C-suite
hires
&#8211;
Chief
Alliance
Officer
Sarah
Howell
and
Chief
Product
