The funding comes courtesy of Great Hill Partners, a private equity firm that specializes in investments in &#8220;high-growth, disruptive companies.&#8221; The investment takes Jumio&#8217;s total funding to more than $255 million, according to Crunchbase. &#8220;Jumio&#8217;s innovations helped establish the identity verification market, and the need to establish someone&#8217;s digital identity remotely has never been greater,&#8221; Jumio CEO Robert Prigge said. The company plans to use the new capital to automate its identity verification solutions, expand the breadth of its Jumio KYX Platform , and further build out the platform&#8217;s suite of AML compliance solutions. As part of the investment, Great Hill Partners&#8217; Nick Cayer and Matt Vettel will join Jumio&#8217;s Board of Directors. Cayer, who has been with Great Hill since 2006, praised the company as &#8220;the de factor global leader in online identity verification, fraud detection, and compliance.&#8221; He added that given the mandate many institutions have to digitize processes such as onboarding and KYC monitoring, firms like Jumio can play a key role in helping them keep pace with the growing volume of digital and mobile-based transactions. Making its Finovate debut in 2013 and being acquired by Centana Growth Partners in 2016, Jumio has verified more than 300 million identities issued by 200+ countries and territories since inception in 2010. With customers and partners in a wide range of verticals &#8211; from financial services and the sharing economy to retail, travel, and online gaming &#8211; Jumio leverages AI, biometrics, machine learning, and certified liveness detection to help ensure that customers are who they claim to be. Jumio&#8217;s KYX Platform, launched last fall , provides organizations with an end-to-end identity verification and eKYC solution that enables them to onboard new accounts safely and accurately, keep existing accounts secure, and meet their compliance obligations with regards to KYC, AML, and GDPR. &#8220;Digital transformation is more than a buzzword. It&#8217;s today&#8217;s business imperative,&#8221; Prigge said. &#8220;To succeed, organizations must transform quickly and do it in ways that build trust, security, and satisfaction. Businesses can tailor the Jumio KYX Platform to fit their unique needs and risks and tap into services that accelerate digital transformation without sacrificing security and convenience.&#8221; Learn more about how Jumio fights deep fakes and bots in our interview from last summer featuring company VP of Marketing, Dean Nicolls.

As part of the partnership, Huckleberry joins Berkshire Hathaway GUARD&#8217;s curated network of independent agents and brokers across the U.S. For Huckleberry, it&#8217;s the largest partnership with an insurance carrier the company has inked since it was founded in 2017.

And even though the IRS has extended the filing deadline by a few weeks, it&#8217;s still a stressful time for both individuals and businesses. In an era of changing benefits, everyone is on the lookout to minimize their tax burden. Enter MainStreet , a company founded in 2019 that helps qualify tech startups for tax credits that most accountants don&#8217;t check for. The California-based company works with startups&#8217; accountants to check for more than 200 potential unclaimed tax credits. MainStreet works by integrating the startups&#8217; payroll and scanning the data on a monthly basis for potential federal, state, and local tax credits. If MainStreet finds a tax credit, the company will advance 80% of the credit amount to the startup so that they can use the funds right away instead of waiting on their tax refund. The client is responsible for repaying that amount, with no interest incurred, after they receive their credit from the government. MainStreet does not charge a fee for this monthly service. Instead, the company keeps the remaining 20% of the startups&#8217; tax credit amount. However, MainStreet only receives payment if it successfully finds a refund for the client. In the event of an audit, MainStreet offers support through the auditing process. And if MainStreet makes an error with the paperwork or credit claim, the client is insured for up to $1 million. So far, MainStreet has found more than $80 million for over 1,000 startups. The company&#8217;s clients include Rally, Newfront Insurance, LedgerX, Pave, and more. In the long term, MainStreet plans to expand its operations beyond serving tech startups to include small businesses, as well. MainStreet has received almost $63 million from investors including Gradient Ventures, Sound Ventures, and Signal Fire.

In a round led by Coatue, Ribbit, and Stripes, digital asset infrastructure specialist Fireblocks has secured $133 million in new capital to power its mission to make it easier for banks to get into the digital asset space. &#8220;Fintechs and banks require not only a specialized custody and settlement infrastructure to ensure customer funds are safely managed, but (also) a platform that enables new lines of digital offerings,&#8221; Fireblocks CEO Michael Shaulov said. He noted that while the company has no plans to become an actual bank itself, &#8220;we believe our infrastructure will lend itself perfectly to power an entirely new era of financial services.&#8221; Also participating in the round as strategic investors were The Bank of New York Mellon and SVB. A number of Fireblocks existing investors also contributed to the round, including Paradigm, Galaxy Digital, Swisscom Ventures, Tenaya Capital and Cyberstarts Ventures. The investment brings the fintech&#8217;s total capital raised to $179 million. Founded in 2018, Fireblocks launched as a digital assets infrastructure company helping crypto-based institutions and exchanges move, store, and issue digital assets. As interest in digital assets &#8211; especially cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum &#8211; has surged, Fireblocks has begun to leverage its talent and technology in digital assets to enable banks and other financial institutions to bring cryptocurrency access to their customers. By linking to its Fireblocks&#8217; platform, banks and fintechs will be able to deploy a wide range of solutions &#8211; from custody, tokenization, and asset management to trading, lending, and payments &#8211; on both public and private blockchain networks. The company&#8217;s investors highlighted Fireblocks&#8217; capacity to enable banks and other financial institutions to efficiently and securely take advantage of the opportunity of and interest in digital assets. CEO of Asset Servicing and Head of Digital for BNY Mellon Roman Regelman said that bridging the gap between traditional and digital assets is &#8220;foundational to the future of custody.&#8221; Coatue Managing Partner Kris Fredrickson concurred: &#8220;our belief (is) that a new financial ecosystem is emerging and (companies) like Fireblocks are essential.&#8221; Last month, Fireblocks announced a partnership with digital payment- platform-as-a-service company, First. Together, the companies introduced a secure wallet and infrastructure solution to enable financial institutions to facilitate transactions via the Diem network . Fireblocks began the year collaborating with global fintech Ibanera to help its customers safely transfer crypto funds in real-time . Since inception, Fireblocks has secured the transfer of more than $400 billion in digital assets. The company is headquartered in New York City.

The U.K.-based company pulled in $28 million (£20 million) from existing investors, bringing its total raised to $465 million. Investors in today&#8217;s round include IAG Silverstripe, which led the round, as well as Augmentum, Alternative Credit Investments, Venture Founders, and others. The company will use the funds to support the growth of its digital bank. Zopa secured its banking license last June and has since transitioned its platform from a peer-to-peer lending operation to a digital bank with a peer-to-peer lending option. Since that time, Zopa began offering savings accounts, which have reached $346 million (£250 million) in customer deposits, and a credit card product that has made Zopa a top 10 credit card issuer in the U.K. based on new customers. The new funding comes at a time when competition among digital banks is at an all-time high. Zopa is poised to do well in the battle for new clients and deposits, however. The company has built a well-established client base, resources, and relationships since it was founded in 2004 as a peer-to-peer lending platform. Zopa CEO Jaidev Janardana echoes this. &#8220;Less than a year since launching our bank, we have exceeded our plan for growth, both in terms of customers and balance sheet,&#8221; he said. &#8220;This capital injection will enable us to continue on this accelerated path. Our strong entry to the U.K. savings and credit card markets shows the organic appeal of our products and we are happy to have investors who share our excitement at the opportunity to serve more customers across more product categories.&#8221; Photo by Paweł Czerwiński on Unsplash Share this: Send Post Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Austria&#8217;s BitPanda Reaches Unicorn Status; A Look at the Latest in French Fintech By David Penn Posted on March 19, 2021 Categories: Finovate Global <!--<div class="sharing"> --> Still looking for evidence that cryptocurrencies have arrived? The $170 million raised this week by Austrian digital asset neobroker Bitpanda is a testament to both the surging interest in cryptocurrencies as well as the vitality of fintech innovation in the CEE countries. Bitpanda&#8217;s Series B round earned the company a valuation of $1.2 billion, giving Austria its first fintech unicorn . The Vienna-based company, founded in 2014 by co-CEOs Eric Demuth and Paul Klanschek, along with CTO Christian Trummer, plans to use the capital to add to the types of investments available on its platform, as well as expand to more markets in Europe. This latest funding round was led by Valar Ventures and featured participation from DST Global. The round is more than triple the amount raised by Bitpanda in its Series A financing back in September, which was also led by Valar Ventures (SpeedInvest of Vienna was an investor in the round, as well). The capital arrives the same week that Bitpanda announced that it had reached a new milestone of more than two million registered users on its Bitpanda and Bitpanda Pro platforms. Bitpanda enables cryptocurrency investors and traders to buy, sell, save, and send more than 50 digital assets including Bitcoin and Ethereum. The neobroker also offers the world&#8217;s first real crypto index and a Bitpanda Card that enables Bitpanda accountholders to spend their digital assets as easily as they spend their cash. With FinovateEurope right around the corner , we&#8217;ve got more than a little continental fintech on the mind these days. This week we take a quick look at fintech news from France, a country whose fintech industry is often overlooked in the broader conversation on European fintech. Earlier this week, we learned that Finovate alum Ledger was launching a new business division dedicated to taking advantage of growing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies . Headquartered in Paris and founded in 2013, the company announced that its Ledger Enterprise Solutions unit will support enterprise adoption of the company&#8217;s core custody technology , Ledger Vault , as well as advise institutional clients with regards to technology implementation, security, and governance of digital asset portfolios. On the French fintech funding beat, PayFit, a payroll and HR platform launched in France in 2016, announced that it has secured $107 million (EUR 90 million) in Series D funding. The investment was led by Eurzeo Growth, Large Venture, and BPI France, and featured participation from the company&#8217;s existing investors Accel, Frst, and individual investor Xavier Niel. The company said that the capital will help support its comprehensive HR solution for SMEs and enable the company &#8211; which also operates in Spain, Germany, the U.K., and Italy &#8211; to &#8220;increase headcount from 550 to 800&#8221; by the end of 2021. PayFit serves more than 5,000 small businesses, and includes Revolut , Starling Bank, and Treatwell among its customers. The company experienced growth of 40% in 2020 &#8211; a pace PayFit anticipates doubling this year &#8211; and credited much of this &#8220;hypergrowth&#8221; to the digital imperative brought on by the COVID-19 crisis. &#8220;As a result of the pandemic, HR professionals have faced a much higher workload and unfamiliar challenges,&#8221; PayFit co-founder and CEO Firmin Zocchetto said . &#8220;They have had to deal with various issues, including supporting the company&#8217;s management with the implementation of remote work policies and ensuring employee wellbeing through new initiatives.&#8221; Zocchetto said that there are &#8220;tens of millions of SMEs&#8221; that are ready for digital transformation. &#8220;The market is huge, and our ambition remains the same: to become the point of reference for payroll and HR management for all SMEs,&#8221; he said. Striking another note in the funding beat, French fintech Silvr announced a EUR 3 million seed investment this week . The company, launched last year by Nima Karimi and Gregory Tappero, provides financing for digital businesses that cannot access traditional bank financing and want to raise equity capital. Silvr offers a revenue-based financing model based on the performance of the financed company, an approach that contrasts with both traditional asset-based lending and fundraising models. Karimi has said that Silvr&#8217;s strategy offers a new option for SMEs in France, calling it simpler and more transparent. Here is our look at fintech innovation around the world.

Terms of the deal were undisclosed. Pindrop anticipates the purchase of NextCaller, a call verification and fraud detection solution for contact centers, will position the company for growth, expand its client base, and position it as an industry leader. &#8220;Our two companies will now be able to service the market in its entirety with the right solution for whatever stage of voice security and authentication they are in,&#8221; said Next Caller Co-founder and CEO Ian Roncoroni. The deal comes at a time when demand for call centers is expanding. In a recent report, Forrester found that 42% of brands surveyed saw an increase in year-over-year call center call volume since the pandemic began. Additionally, 65% of companies reported they struggle to manage the high call volume and 80% of firms reported that fraud is a very serious issue in the call center. Given this, Pindrop CEO Vijay Balasubramaniyan has a positive outlook for the fraud prevention industry. &#8220;We couldn’t be more bullish about the future,&#8221; he said, &#8220;The need for our combined solutions will only continue to grow as brands across multiple industries not only look to better secure their voice channel, but also improve the customer experience.

The platform, Red Hat OpenShift , will enable Nymbus to help its community bank and credit union customers accelerate their digital transformations . &#8220;The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way we bank, possibly forever,&#8221; Nymbus CEO Jeffery Kendall said. &#8220;It provided the push for local banks and credit unions to establish more secure, flexible, end-to-end digital banking solutions.&#8221; Kendall added that the partnership with Red Hat would give Nymbus&#8217; partners more &#8220;freedom of choice&#8221; in the way they implemented their cloud banking strategies as well as the &#8220;multi-cloud uptime&#8221; Kendall said was &#8220;critical for the banking industry.&#8221; Courtesy of the new partnership, Nymbus customers will be able to deploy and launch a turnkey, digital bank-in-a-box &#8211; running on OpenShift &#8211; on whatever cloud platform they prefer. The open source, cloud-agnostic nature of Red Hat&#8217;s solution helps institutions avoid being dependent on a sole vendor, which can impede innovation. &#8220;Cloud technology is reshaping the way banking services are created and delivered in our digital world,&#8221; Red Hat VP and Global Head of Financial Services Richard Harmon said. &#8220;It is providing service providers the ability to quickly adapt to market changes and make it easier for community banks and credit unions to consume new software.
