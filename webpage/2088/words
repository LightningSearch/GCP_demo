Wilson
Pang
is
the
Chief
Technology
Officer
at
Appen
,
where
he
leads
a
group
of
world-class
data
scientists,
engineers,
and
product
managers
to
combine
the
power
of
technology
and
humans
to
solve
the
AI
data
problems.
In
this
interview
we
discuss
AI
ethics, 
Appen&#8217;s
2020
State
of
AI
and
Machine
Learning
Report
and
current
industry
challenges.
What
was
it
that
attracted
you
personally
to
software
engineering
and
data
science
?
I
received
the
opportunity
to
work
on
data
and
AI
10
years
ago.
In
the
AI
world,
developers
are
no
longer
controlling
logic
in
code,
instead,
data
is
deciding
the
logic
of
the
AI
model
which
is
fascinating.
I
started
my
career
as
a
developer
with
IBM,
building
large
systems
for
banks,
telecom
operators
and
securities
exchange
companies.
I
was
excited
by
the
power
of
software
and
AI.
I
am
also
lucky
to
see
how
data
and
machine
learning
help
to
grow
business
firsthand.
My
team
at
eBay
leveraged
AI
to
increase
buyer
purchases
thus
increasing
tens
of
millions
in
revenue.
We
used
AI
to
increase
internal
efficiency
and
reduce
operational
costs
significantly
for
Trip.com.
Now
at
Appen,
we
are
helping
companies
from
all
kinds
of
industries
use
AI
to
drive
success
of
their
business.
&nbsp;
Could
you
describe
some
of
Appen’s
AI
and
data
labeling
offerings?
We
are
a
training
data
provider
working
with
over
1
million
contractors
to
collect
and
label
images,
text,
speech,
audio,
video,
and
other
data.
Those
contractors
reside
in
over
130
countries
and
speak
180
languages
and
dialects
which
gives
us
the
ability
to
provide
high
quality
data
for
AI
projects. We
also
have
professional
teams
who
have
worked
in
AI
data
for
more
than
20
years
and
have
a
lot
of
knowledge
on
how
to
get
the
training
data
right. Last
but
not
least,
we
have
an
industry
leading
AI-assisted
annotation
platform
which
has
built-in
features
to
assure
quality
and
productivity. Our
customers
can
choose
between
our
managed
service
solution
where
we
partner
with
their
team,
or
the
self-service
platform. Our
AI-assisted
data
annotation
platform
gives
customers
the
ability
to
manage
projects
along
with machine
learning
assisted
tools
to
enhance
quality,
accuracy,
and
annotation
speed.
With
more
than
20
years
of
experience,
our
services
offer
world-class
training
data,
the
most
advanced
AI-
assisted
data
annotation
platform,
and
a
diverse,
global
crowd
to
ensure
high-quality
data.
&nbsp;
What
are
some
of
the
open
source
data
sets
that
are
available?
Appen
has
several
open
source
data
sets
available
online
from
image
annotation
to
handwriting
recognition.
These
data
sets
are
free
to
download
and
can
be
used
to
help
build
and
train
your
AI
model.
One
of
the
most
interesting
sets
available
is
on
nucleus
segmentation
from
medical
images.
The
data
contains
more
than
21000
nuclei
annotated
and
validated
by
medical
experts.
&nbsp;
What
was
your
biggest
personal
take
away
from
the
2020
State
of
AI
and
Machine
Learning
Report
?
The
most
interesting
finding
from
the
report
was
the
increase
in
C-Suite
involvement.
I
had
been
hearing
about
it,
but
to
see
the
increase
by
31%
from
last
year
was
a
big
surprise.
AI
is
becoming
a
part
of
core
business
and
not
just
with
tech
leaders.
&nbsp;
One
cause
for
concern
in
the
report
is
that
only
25%
of
companies
stated
that
unbiased
AI
is
mission
critical.
Do
you
believe
that
this
is
due
to
lack
of
education
on
the
importance
of
removing
AI
bias?
What
needs
to
be
done
to
improve
these
statistics?
Yes,
education
is
the
first
step
to
improving
that
statistic.
An
AI
model
built
on
biased
data
will
deliver
biased
results
and
never
be
fully
successful.
Business
leaders
need
to
learn
the
importance
of
having
unbiased
data
and
how
that
leads
to
a
successful
deployment.
&nbsp;
What
are
some
AI
ethics
that
companies
should
consider
when
working
with
AI
and
large
data
sets?
It’s
important
to
look
at
where
the
data
came
from.
Is
that
data
being
ethically
sourced
and
unbiased?
When
looking
at
where
it
was
sourced,
you
want
to
know
if
the
people
were
paid
a
fair
wage
and
if
the
data
came
from
a
diverse
group.
We
recently
released
our
Crowd
Code
of
Ethics
in
support
of
inclusion,
diversity,
fair
pay,
and
communication
for
our
contributors.
&nbsp;
What
do
you
view
as
the
current
biggest
industry
challenge?
Lack
of
data
and
data
management
is
the
biggest
challenge
for
the
industry.
Teams
have
a
lot
of
decisions
that
they
need
to
make
about
the
data
and
many
have
challenges
recognizing
what
they
need.
They
need
to
understand
what
data
they
have,
where
it
came
from
and
what
data
they
still
need.
All
that
data
management
is
important
to
building
and
training
an
AI
model.
Lack
of
data
can
lead
to
a
biased
model
which
in
turn
will
not
be
successful.
&nbsp;
Appen
has
been
releasing
the
State
of
AI
and
Machine
Learning
Reports
for
many
years
now.
When
was
the
first
report
launched
and
what
are
some
of
the
biggest
changes
that
have
been
seen
since
this
initial
report?
The
first
report
was
launched
in
2015
and
the
biggest
change
we’ve
seen
is
in
ownership
of
AI
projects.
The
first
report
was
primarily
answered
by
data
scientists
who
managed
AI
for
their
companies.
Today,
71%
state
C-Suite
ownership
which
indicates
a
huge
shift
in
perspective
of
AI
becoming
more
critical
to
businesses.
Data
scientists
also
faced
many
challenges
from
lack
of
resources
to
build
valuable
insights
from
the
data
to
unclear
goals
and
unrealistic
expectations.
However,
one
of
the
key
challenges
remains
the
same
around
data
and
data
management.
&nbsp;
Is
there
anything
else
that
you
would
like
to
share
about
Appen?
 
On
July
16,
we’re
excited
to
host
the
first
virtual
round
table
on
launching
AI
in
the
real
world
on
Appen.com.
The
four-part
series
features
industry-leading
practitioners
sharing
personal
experiences
and
insights
into
their
own
AI
journeys,
shedding
light
so
others
can
accelerate
progress
toward
their
AI-initiatives.
To
succeed,
companies
will
have
to
be
prepared
to
overcome
several
common
challenges
around
data,
ethics,
people,
and
lifecycles.
In
the
first
edition,
bring
together
leading
experts
to
share
what
it
means
to
them
and
their
organization
to
participate
in
creating
responsible
AI.
Thank
you
for
the
interview.
