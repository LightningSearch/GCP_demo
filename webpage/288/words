Clinc
And
OCBC
Are
Now
Running
Singapore&#8217;s
First
Conversational
AI
Virtual
Banking
Tool
Clinc,
the
creators
behind
one
of
the
most sophisticated
natural
language
artificial
intelligence
tools,
announced
that
it
partnered
with
Singapore’s
second-largest
financial
services
group:
OCBC
Bank
Clinc
—
the
creators
behind
one
of
the
most
sophisticated
natural
language
artificial
intelligence
tools
in
the
world
—
announced
recently
that
Singapore’s
second-largest
financial
services
group,
OCBC
Bank,
has
launched
a
voice-enabled
mobile
banking
assistant
powered
by
Clinc.
The
assistant
is
the
first
of
its
kind
in
Singapore
and
is
available
to
all
OCBC
Bank
customers.
OCBC
Bank’s
mobile
banking
customers
now
have
access
to
bank
services
in
a
natural
and
conversational
way
through
the
OCBC
Banking
Assistant
on
the
OCBC
Mobile
Banking
app.
With
no
special
keywords,
phrases
to
memorize
or
templated
questions
to
learn,
customers
can
pay
bills,
get
smart
insights
about
their
finances,
and
receive
help
locating
an
ATM
–
all
through
natural
language
voice
or
text.
“This
is
the
first
full
production
rollout
of
its
kind,”
said
Clinc
CEO
Jason
Mars
in
a
statement.
“It’s
not
a
chatbot
or
virtual
assistant-type
experience
that
people
are
familiar
with.
Rather
it’s
Clinc’s
signature
voice-first
human-like
AI
experience
used
to
create
a
mobile
bank
assistant
that
enables
OCBC
Bank
customers
to
get
spending
insights,
account
and
transaction
details,
and
pay
bills,
all
by
using
unscripted,
everyday,
messy
language.
This
is
a
milestone
for
Clinc,
our
partners
at
OCBC
Bank,
and
the
financial
industry
as
a
whole.”
Clinc’s
bill
payment
competency
is
now
being
used
in
its
entirety
for
the
first
time.
The
bill
payment
skill
enables
payments
to
be
made
by
voice
to
billers
including
credit
cards
in
Singapore,
telecommunication
companies,
utility
companies,
and
town
councils.
With
their
voice,
customers
can
pay
bills,
transfer
funds
between
accounts,
check
spending
history
and
patterns,
locate
the
nearest
ATM,
receive
spending
advice,
and
review
transactions.
“We
are
always
open
to
forging
new
partnerships
that
allow
us
to
reimagine
banking
for
our
digital
customers.
We
chose
to
work
with
Clinc
because
of
their
superior
conversational
AI
platform
and
their
next-generation
natural
language
processing
capabilities.
This
partnership
is
the
next
step
towards
making
our
customers’
mobile-first
interactions
more
seamless
and
natural,”
added
Aditya
Gupta,
the
Head
of
Digital
Business
for
Singapore
&amp;
Malaysia
at
OCBC
Bank.
Since
launching
its
first
product
in
2016,
Clinc
has
seen
tremendous
success
with
dozens
of
partners
and
deployments
on
3
continents.
And
the
company
has
built
virtual
assistants
and
conversational
AI
experiences
for
some
of
the
most
well-respected
financial
institutions
in
the
world
including
Barclays,
USAA,
Isbank,
and
OCBC
Bank.
Plus
Clinc
also
brought
its
artificial
intelligence
platform
to
automakers,
quick-service
restaurants,
and
healthcare
companies.
Through
these
partners,
Clinc’s
platform
is
now
accessible
to
over
35
million
users.
