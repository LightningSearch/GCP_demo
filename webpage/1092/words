From

daily

business,
politics,
sports,
and,
over

A

has
been
the
outdoor
recreational
sector,
especially
among
private

as
the
outbreak

March
encouraged
more

to

5G,
artificial

bring
greater

expand

The

thousands

In

Macomb
County
will
embark
on
a
$217-million
project
to
reconstruct
a
nine-mile
stretch
of
Mound
Road,
from
I-696
to
M-59,
which
runs
through
the
cities
of
Warren
and

Heights.
While
funding
for
such
large-scale
projects
is
challenging
—
the
county
secured
a
vital
federal
grant
in

—
the
fact
is
it’s
also

to
have
