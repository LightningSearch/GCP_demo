Celebrating
and
empowering
women
in
fintech
is
something
Finovate
supports
throughout
the
year,
not
just
during
Womens&#8217;
History
Month
and
on
International
Womens&#8217;
Day
&#8211;
earlier
this
week,
on
March
8.
And
you
may
have
already
seen
our
next
guest
contributor,
Janice
Diner,
CEO,
Founder
of
Horizn, across
other
parts
of
the
Finovate
ecosystem.
Be
it
on
the
Finovate
Podcast
to
talk
educating
customers
and
turning
employees
into
digital
advocates,
or
at
the
physical
(or
digital!)
Finovate
events
following
Horizn&#8217;s
latest
demo
.
Today,
Diner
shares
her
journey
through
fintech
as
part
of
our
#womeninfintech
series.
What
barriers
did
you
face,
as
a
woman,
in
becoming
successful
in
your
field
and
how
did
you
overcome
them?
Janice
Diner:
I
think
of
my
career
in
two
phases,
before
I
was
the
CEO
and
founder
of
Horizn
I
was
a
successful
Creative
Director.
I
had
no
concept
of
the
“glass
ceiling”,
I
was
part
of
the
3%
of
successful
women
in
advertising.
When
I
got
into
tech
and
started
Horizn,
all
that
changed.
Back
in
2013
issues
that
presented
barriers
to
female
entrepreneurs
weren&#8217;t
as
loudly
discussed.
I
remember
feeling
it
in
the
room,
when
you
are
or
have
been
successful,
you
know
what
a
winning
room
smells
like.
I
often
talk
about
being
bootstrapped
and
proud.
The
hidden
story
behind
that
statement
reflects
my
early
experiences
at
fundraising
in
2013.
Remember,
I
had
a
full-blown
creative
director
ego
and
had
no
concept
of
‘ceilings’.
But
I
ran
into
the
“female”
problem
of
fundraising
at
the
time
and
smashed
right
into
that
ceiling.
At
the
time
it
seemed
like
a
monumental
problem,
but
we
turned
it
into
an
opportunity
and
we
walked
in
another
direction.&nbsp;
I
think
it
has
to
do
with
how
we
look
at
money,
I
look
at
money
as
fuel
—
it’s
all
equal
to
me.
At
the
end
of
the
day,
money
is
capital
to
build
and
run
my
business,
that’s
true
no
matter
where
that
money
comes
from,
whether
it
is
venture
capital,
client
revenue
or
debt
financing.
And
what
about
now,
in
2021?
Diner:
I
am
now
in
my
10th
year
of
running
the
business.
We
are
an
award
winning
fintech
helping
many
of
the
world’s
largest
banks.
There
is
no
doubt
the
future
of
banking
will
rely
on
digital
platforms
and
the
widespread
adoption
of
new
technologies.
With
that
certainty
in
mind,
Horizn
equips
both
bank
customers
and
employees
with
the
knowledge
needed
to
accelerate
digital
banking
knowledge,
fluency
and
adoption.
We
won
two
Best
of
Show
Finovate
awards
in
2020
and
have
multiple
client
awards.
I
am
most
proud
when
our
clients
speak
for
us
about
their
success
with
Horizn,
in
articles,
in
fireside
chats,
webinars
and
on
stage.
What
was
your
first
experience
at
Finovate
like
as
a
female
CEO?
Diner:
I
remember
my
first
Finovate
event
back
in
2015,
I
was
one
of
a
few
female
CEOs
on
stage,
nothing
new
for
me.
But
this
time
was
different.
Women
came
up
to
me
afterwards
just
to
thank
me
for
representing.
They
were
just
happy
to
see
a
female
tech
CEO
on
stage.
At
Horizn
we
are
very
grateful
to
benefit
from
the
diversity
Toronto
has
to
offer;
together
at
Horizn
we
speak
20
languages
and
come
from
15
countries.
The
team
is
made
up
of
44%
women,
impressive
for
a
tech
company.
On
International
Women’s
Day,
what
is
the
most
important
message
you
want
to
send
out
to
young
women
thinking
about
their
careers?
Diner:
When
asked
the
question
what
advice
would
you
give
women,
I
think
my
advice
is
to
entrepreneurs
in
general.
Do
what
you
love
and
be
good
at
it,
the
rest
will
come.
The
five
ways
I
have
built
the
business
are&#8230;
Build
product
in
real
time
with
your
customers
Love
your
customers
and
make
them
love
you
Visit/speak
to
your
customers
and
go
to
industry
events
(or
virtual
&#8211;
COVID)
Hire
the
best
—
people
are
everything
when
you
are
building
a
great
company
Remember
you
are
not
in
the
start-up
business.
You
are
in
a
business.
In
summary
however
I
found
regardless
of
what
barriers
I
may
have
had
or
which
doors
have
not
necessarily
open
as
I
would
have
expected,
it
is
always
important
to
look
at
them
from
an
opportunity
perspective.
Success
is
pretty
much
how
you
choose
to
define
it.

Continuing
our
#womeninfintech
series,
we
ask
Regina
Lau,
Chief
Strategy
Officer,
Retail
Merchant
Services,
a
TVC
Portfolio
Company
and
Executive
Board
Member
of
European
Women
Payments
Network
(EWPN),
about
her
thoughts
on
International
Women&#8217;s
Day
and
the
challenges
and
opportunities
for
women
in
the
industry.
What
does
IWD
&amp;
#ChooseToChallenge
mean
to
you
in
your
work
life?
Regina
Lau:
International
Womens&#8217;
Day
(IWD)
is
a
day
to
celebrate
all
the
achievements
from
women
around
the
world
and
also
all
the
women
who
have
been
inspirational
role
models,
no
matter
if
they
made
big
headlines
or
not.
As
a
member
of
the
Executive
Board
of
European
Women
Payments
Network
(EWPN),
this
is
also
a
very
important
day
for
us
to
continue
the
call
for
change
and
recommit
to
supporting
all
women.
I
believe
that
“when
one
rises,
we
all
rise”.
What
barriers
did
you
face,
as
a
woman,
in
becoming
successful
in
your
field
and
how
did
you
overcome
them?
Lau:
I&#8217;ve
always
worked
in
male
dominated
industries,
so
I
was
often
the
only
woman
in
the
room
(or
at
my
level).&nbsp;
It
was
challenging
to
ensure
that
my
perspective
and
ideas
were
heard.&nbsp;&nbsp;I
built
as
many
relationships
as
possible
with
people
who
I
knew
supported
and
championed
me.&nbsp;I
also
made
sure
I
participated
in
discussions
and
meetings
&#8211;
if
I
was
at
the
table,
I
was
speaking
up.&nbsp;&nbsp;
How
could
men
contribute
to
support
gender
equality?
Lau:
Mentor
and
sponsor
women
and
give
them
equal
access
to
opportunities.&nbsp;Give
women
credit.&nbsp;View
women
through
the
&#8220;people&#8221;
lens
&#8211;
speak
up
and
stop
gender-biased
language
and
descriptors
(i.e.
when
a
woman
speaks
in
a
direct
style
or
promotes
her
ideas,
she
is
often
called
“aggressive”
and
“ambitious.”
But
when
a
man
does
the
same,
he
is
seen
as
“confident”
and
“strong.”)&nbsp;
Can
you
tell
us
about
your
role
model
who
have
inspired
you
over
your
career?
Lau:
I&#8217;ve
admired
many
different
women
and
men
over
my
life.&nbsp;
One
piece
of
advice
that
stuck
with
me
was
&#8220;you
deserve
a
seat
at
the
table,
and
when
you
get
that
seat
at
the
table,
make
it
count&#8221;.&nbsp;&nbsp;
How
important
is
it
for
women
to
lift
each
other
up
and
what
does
that
mean
to
you?
Lau:
This
is
so
important.&nbsp;
I
had
very
few
female
role
models
growing
up
and
throughout
most
of
my
career.&nbsp;
I
wasn&#8217;t
sure
who
had
also
experienced
the
same
challenges
I
faced,
and
I
didn&#8217;t
know
who
to
go
to
for
support.&nbsp;
This
has
made
me
even
more
aware
of
the
need
to
support
other
women,
no
matter
how
small
or
big.&nbsp;
Sometimes,
people
just
need
a
listening
ear
or
to
know
that
someone
else
has
gone
through
it
before.&nbsp;&nbsp;
What
is
your
favourite
part
of
your
job?
And
then
the
most
rewarding?
Lau:
Working
in
teams
with
colleagues
and
partners
to
solve
problems
is
my
favourite,
and
mentoring
&amp;
coaching
both
women
and
men
to
help
them
grow
and
learn
is
very
rewarding.
On
International
Women’s
Day,
what
is
the
most
important
message
you
want
to
send
out
to
young
women
thinking
about
their
careers?
Lau:
Be
bold,
try
new
things
and
don&#8217;t
underestimate
yourself.&nbsp;
You
won&#8217;t
know
unless
you
try
&#8211;
and
if
you
need
to,
try
again.
