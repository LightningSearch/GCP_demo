What can often be lacking are the voices exploring the moral and ethical justifications around technology deployments, and the consideration around how we can ensure that all the advancements in the finance industry will benefit everyone. Here, we bring you conversations centering around the future of fintech and why it is so important to have these conversations now.   Tan Le, Founder and CEO at EMOTIV on why its important to ensure new technology is inclusive Olga Miler, former MD and Global Programme Architect at UBS Wealth Management on improving women&#8217;s customer experience within finance Giulio Montemagno, Head of Europe at Amazon Pay on deviceless transactions and the future of voice technology Harrie Vollard, Head of Rabo Frontier Ventures at Rabobank on what start-ups in accelerators need to focus on to be successful Share this: Send Post Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Women in FinTech: It&#8217;s Time to Jump Right In By charlotteburgess Posted on March 20, 2019 Categories: FinovateSpring 2019 <!--<div class="sharing"> --> As part of Finovate Live , and our #WomeninFinTech series, we sat down with Mary Wisniewski,  Consumer Banking and Fintech Reporter at Bankrate, to get her take on the fintech industry, looking from the outside in, and what she thinks can be done to help close the gap and get more women into the sector. Mary will be chairing the Digital Banking stream at FinovateSpring  in San Francisco this May. Find out more about how you can get involved. Finovate: How did you start your career? Mary Wisniewski: I started my journalism career by writing about high-end jewelry for a business audience. Then I stumbled into writing about tech that debt collectors use to collect arrears. After that, I found myself blogging about fintech for Bank Innovation. Since then (and + 10 years), I haven’t parted ways with the fintech and digital banking beat. Finovate: Why is fintech an exciting industry to be a part of in 2019? Wisniewski: Because of the possibilities. There’s so much promise for fintech to help improve traditional banking products and services for consumers – including by revamping the credit score system. That’s huge. As a reporter, I find the industry fascinating to cover. Banking is in the middle of an existential crisis, and the story possibilities are endless. Finovate: What is your prediction for fintech over the next 5 years? Wisniewski: The way consumers share their data to use fintech services – and/or get products – will continue to move away from requiring them to hand over their bank user names and passwords. As the model evolves and banks use APIs over screen scraping, we must all stay tuned to the risk of banks calling the shots of what data they share or don’t share. We also need to pay attention to how inclusive the new data-sharing model is. While there are a lot of headlines about banks and fintech companies working as partners more than ever, I believe it’s not quite so cheery as that. There are a lot of battles ahead. Finovate: Do you think we see too few women in fintech? Wisniewski: Yes. There is a gender imbalance. Just look at the empty women’s bathroom lines at conferences as evidence. In fact, this issue is something I blogged about in 2015 for American Banker. I could re-post this again today – my points remain the same. Finovate: How can businesses better attract and retain female talent? Wisniewski: This question is a hard one to answer, so I also sought input from a pro and my pal, Bonnie McGeer, the executive editor of American Banker. What follows are some actionable ideas – some from her and a couple from me &#8211; all of which I support: Make sure women feel respected in the workplace &#8211; and that includes with raises. It also includes supporting their ideas with budget. Avoid &#8220;bro club&#8221; vibes, including by not making women the butt of jokes. Comments like “you’re a lot better looking than the last guy sitting here” need to stop, too. Require all those in leadership to be an official mentor/sponsor for one year to at least two employees (one male, one female) who are relatively new hires. Go beyond golf for networking opportunities. Make diverse hiring/promotions a component of annual evaluations for every manager that does hiring, and make poor performers on this component ineligible for raises/promotions that year. If women are at 10% overall of hiring/promotions for a particular group, that’s not acceptable. Finovate: What advice would you have for women starting their career in fintech? Wisniewski: Jump right in. You’ll get annoyed at times. But there are so many wonderful people in this industry – connect with them, at events and on Twitter. Also, don’t feel intimidated. Yes, there are people who have worked in fintech for a long time. But you’ll have something to offer they might not. You’ll feel in your zone soon enough. If you do get nervous, don’t underestimate what a power song can do before speaking to someone. Share this: Send Post Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Can Your Bank Deliver a Better Customer Experience? By charlotteburgess Posted on March 20, 2019 Categories: Customer Acquisition , Customer satisfaction , Customer/Tech Support , Finovate <!--<div class="sharing"> --> Steven Ramirez , CEO of Beyond the Arc , explores why customer experience has jumped to front of mind for most banks, and why there is no silver bullet to solve poor customer experiences. Success, he explains, is a medley of understanding your customer, deploying new technology, and keeping your staff happy, too. S teven will be chairing the Customer Experience Summit Day at FinovateSpring this year in San Francisco, May 7 through 10. Find out more about this deep-dive day, or the full event. Five years ago, no one in financial services was talking much about customer experience. Customer service? Sure. Customer satisfaction? Perhaps. But organizations weren’t equipped to examine the entire lifecycle of interactions that a person has as they learn about a bank, explore its products, become a customer, manage an account, and perhaps ultimately decide to leave or stay. For one thing, the siloed nature of many organizations doesn’t create an incentive to think about a customer relationship holistically. Fast forward a few years, and much has changed. Banks and credit unions realize that they are essentially in a commoditized business. They understand that with so much similarity in products and services, one of the only ways to differentiate is based on the experience they deliver. But therein lies the challenge: what investments in technology, processes, and talent are most likely to improve customer experience? Technology companies like Amazon, Apple, and Google have disrupted a range of industries from advertising, to retail, to computer hardware. In 2019, they’ll increasingly target financial services. With this growth in TechFin, we can expect to see the creation of financial experiences, not just new products or services. The way people receive a paycheck, spend it, and save for the future will be technology-enabled to better reflect their personal needs and long-term goals. This means you can’t just plug-in a new technology and hope to transform. The importance of customer understanding Your first investments need to be in better understanding your customers—both the ones you have today, and the ones you hope to attract in the future. In a recent study about innovation , only 18.3% of companies identified themselves as a Digital Leader. And on a similar note, just 29.5% said they were very excited about “their ability to adapt over the next three years.” Critical to both is the necessity to know more about your customers, and their needs, than ever before. With the explosion of data, and the tools to derive insights from it, you can now improve customer experience by spotting previously undiscoverable trends and taking action. You can see how machine learning, cloud and edge computing, and more robust data integration capabilities could play a role. Personalization at scale Investments in customer understanding help to fuel progress in personalization. Cutting-edge marketing from ten years ago emphasized the importance of sophisticated segmentation. Today, your customers want to feel like you’ve tailored your offering to meet their unique requirements. An important implication of this is that you need to communicate with the audience of one .However , you need to do this at scale for thousands, or millions, of people. Each person, as an individual, must feel that you are considering their needs, and only their needs, when they interact with you. Predictive analytics can enable real-time solutions that match customers with the most appropriate products and services, at just the right time for them. Improve employee experience to improve customer experience As Beyond the Arc strategist Michelle Espinoza notes in our recently published CX trends article , “Companies are focusing so intensely on CX, they’re losing sight of the employee experience.” She goes on to note that, “just like Amazon set the bar for CX, we can expect to see companies emerge that set the bar for employee experience as well.” I can think of several leading companies that get this right: Disney, Zappos, Ultimate Software (a BTA client), Salesforce, and others. What will it take for your bank to make this list? And what tools and technology might help to ensure your success? Machine learning can help tie your recruitment process to key success factors for various jobs. Business intelligence, real-time alerts, and robotic process automation (RPA) can help you to report on, and streamline, operational conditions so your employees can remove customer pain points. Tech, transformation, and the future of CX at your bank Unfortunately, there’s no simple recipe to transform customer experience. If there was one, your raw ingredients would include better customer understanding, personalization, and employee engagement. In their book Outside In , Kelly Bodine and Harley Manning argue that there are billions of dollars at stake. They cite the example of Fidelity: when clients had a good experience, they invested 4.5 times more with the firm than people who did not, amounting to billions in incremental assets every year. And telecom provider Sprint saved $1.7 billion from averted customer service calls per year. Technology can certainly help you to acquire vital new capabilities. But to achieve success, your bank will need to treat CX as a core business process, focus your resources on measurable improvements, and invest in both people and technology.

But in 2019, we expect they&#8217;ll put past differences aside and finally cozy up to each other. &#8220;Partnerships&#8221; will be the buzzword for the new year as incumbent players realize they must embrace tech to meet the  demands of their millennial clients , while so-called fintech players realize sometimes clients really do want the intimacy of a face-to-face meeting. As proof of concept, look no further than Morgan Stanley&#8217;s recently announced bid to buy Solium Capital in a $900 million all-cash deal &#8211; its biggest acquisition since the financial crisis. By snatching up the Canada-based employee stock plan administrator, which counts Hootsuite and Dropbox among its clients,  Morgan Stanley hopes to facilitate a path to draw millennials into its wealth management practice .  Solium, meanwhile, receives the backing of one of the largest banks in the United States . We expect to see more of this in 2019 &#8211; whether it&#8217;s outright acquisitions of smaller players or strategic partnerships between incumbents and fintech players. With the $30 trillion generational wealth transfer  in its early innings, pure-play robo-advisers are finding that their algorithmic services aren&#8217;t enough to win over millennials on the brink of their asset accumulation years. A robo-adviser may be sufficient when a plan is in place, but fintech and artificial intelligence (AI) have yet to replicate the insights gleaned or the comfort level achieved through one-on-one conversations. This is especially true for young families balancing student loan payments, first homes, and education planning for young children. Even my millennial son told me he was frustrated that robo-advisers kept being pushed on him when he really wanted a human adviser to help him navigate through the world of investments. But it&#8217;s not just the robo-advisers that gain from partnering with incumbents. Traditional wealth managers also benefit by having their services buttressed by fintech players. It&#8217;s no longer an all-or-nothing dance between the two: Incumbents can leverage in-house technology to spend more time forging meaningful client relationships. What we&#8217;re seeing in 2019 is that an industry once known for its left-brained quantitative skills can now work the right side of its brain &#8211; all thanks to technology, ironically. Clients will soon be benefiting from hybrid advice. While algorithms can quickly churn out portfolio options that advisers previously spent days crafting, advisers today can use the time saved to think more critically about their recommendations. Rather than prescribing financial advice, they can embrace a more holistic approach to determine what their clients want and how they feel about their portfolio and wealth. But the expected partnerships in the wealth management industry don&#8217;t just apply to adviser-client dynamics. Total investable assets in North America are expected to grow by nearly 10%, to $28.8 trillion by 2021, according to a  2018 Ernst &amp; Young study . And that wealth is not just concentrated in a mix of stocks and bonds. The era&#8217;s low interest rates have compelled households to allocate some of their wealth to alternative asset classes. For this reason, advisers need to know how to manage and analyze diverse holdings. And as the wealth management industry continues to grow &#8211; both in terms of assets and clients from the wealth transfer &#8211; it will need to attract a young, engaged workforce to meet increasing and evolving demands. Analog solutions won&#8217;t cut it in a digitized world, especially when it comes to luring talent away from Silicon Valley. While many firms previously relied on a patchwork of legacy systems to conduct business, today&#8217;s younger workforce wants clean, reliable interfaces to complete their work. We expect to see increased intergenerational team partnerships in the wealth management industry. After all, the &#8220;average&#8221; adviser is 55 &#8211; and perhaps thinking of their own retirement. We anticipate they will be leaning on their younger staffs and calling on their expertise. While advisers may have the years of experience, younger employees &#8211; and digital natives &#8211; will know new ways of reaching existing clients and prospects. The room for partnerships in 2019 extends throughout the wealth management pipeline. From mergers between incumbent and fintech players to generationally diverse teams amid the wealth transfer, it&#8217;s clear we&#8217;re moving from conversation to commitment.
