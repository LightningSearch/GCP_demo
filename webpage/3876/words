FinovateFall
brought
together
fintech
innovators
from
all
over
the
world
and
representatives
from
some
of
the
largest
banks
in
the
U.S.,
so
naturally
there
were
discussions
around
forging
new
partnerships
and
benefiting
from
the
culture
and
technology
shared
between
the
different
sides.
We
sat
down
with
some
of
the
key
speakers
to
get
their
insights
on
how
legacy
banks
and
financial
institutions
can
compete
or
collaborate
in
this
new
era.
Jeremy
Balkin,
Head
of
Innovation,
Retail
Banking
&amp;
Wealth
Management,
HSBC
USA
on
successful
innovation
projects
and
how
to
get
them
off
the
ground.
Mary
Jane
Ajodah,
Vice
President,
Strategy,
BNY
Mellon,
on
how
legacy
banks
can
leapfrog
start-ups
&#8211;
when
they
have
the
right
strategy.
Steven
Ramirez,
CEO
at
Beyond
the
Arc,
discusses
the
new
trends
he&#8217;s
noticed
emerging
from
the
shadows.
Jim
Marous, Publisher
/
Fintech
Strategist,
The
Financial
Brand/The
Digital
Banking
Report
explores
why
historical
success
can
be
a
liability,
as
well
as
an
asset
for
a
bank.
