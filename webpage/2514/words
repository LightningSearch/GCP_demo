As
long
as
companies
continue
to
make
money,
there
will
be
those
whose
stock
prices
do
not
fully
reflect
their
true
worth.
Buy
these,
hold
these
and
wait.
You
may
be
surprised
at
just
how
well
such
a
boring
strategy
can
work.

"To
invest
successfully
over
a
lifetime
does
not
require
a
stratospheric
IQ,
unusual
business
insights
or
inside
information.
What’s
needed
is
a
sound
intellectual
framework
for
making
decisions
and
the
ability
to
keep
emotions
from
corroding
that
framework."

The
two
most
critical
skills
for
investment
success
is
the
ability
to
identify
a
quality
company
and
to
recognize
when
it
offers
good
value;
everything
else
is
a
distraction.
