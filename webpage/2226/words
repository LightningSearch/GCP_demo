Driving
User
Engagement,
Embracing

And
Serving
A
Real-Time
Experience
As

gets
into
full
swing,
it
is
a
good
time
to
look
ahead
to
what
we
can
expect
in
the
coming
months
in
our
industry.
What
cropped
up
repeatedly
in
my
interviews
was
how
OEMs
and
carriers
will
need
to
further
adapt
to
drive
user
engagement
and
the
importance
of
real-time
user
experiences.
