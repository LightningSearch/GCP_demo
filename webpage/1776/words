Text
classification
is
the
process
of
analyzing
text
sequences
and
assigning
them
a
label,
putting
them
in
a
group
based
on
their
content.
Text
classification
underlies
almost
any
AI
or
machine
learning
task
involving
Natural
Language
Processing
(NLP).
With
text
classification,
a
computer
program
can
carry
out
a
wide
variety
of
different
tasks
like
spam
recognition,
sentiment
analysis,
and
chatbot
functions.
How
does
text
classification
work
exactly?
What
are
the
different
methods
of
carrying
out
text
classification?
We’ll
explore
the
answers
to
these
questions
below.
Defining
Text
Classification
It’s
important
to
take
some
time
and
make
sure
that
we
understand
what
text
classification
is
,
in
general,
before
delving
into
the
different
methods
of
doing
text
classification.
Text
classification
is
one
of
those
terms
that
is
applied
to
many
different
tasks
and
algorithms,
so
it&#8217;s
useful
to
make
sure
that
we
understand
the
basic
concept
of
text
classification
before
moving
on
to
explore
the
different
ways
that
it
can
be
carried
out.
Anything
that
involves
creating
different
categories
for
text,
and
then
labeling
different
text
samples
as
these
categories,
can
be
considered
text
classification.
As
long
as
a
system
carries
out
these
basic
steps
it
can
be
considered
a
text
classifier,
regardless
of
the
exact
method
used
to
classify
the
text
and
regardless
of
how
the
text
classifier
is
eventually
applied.
Detecting
email
spam,
organizing
documents
by
topic
or
title,
and
recognizing
the
sentiment
of
a
review
for
a
product
are
all
examples
of
text
classification
because
they
are
accomplished
by
taking
text
as
an
input
and
outputting
a
class
label
for
that
piece
of
text.

Most
text
classification
methods
can
be
placed
into
one
of
three
different
categories:
rule-based
methods
or
machine
learning
methods.
Rule-Based
Classification
Methods
Rule-based
text
classification
methods
operate
through
the
use
of
explicitly
engineered
linguistic
rules.
The
system
uses
the
rules
created
by
the
engineer
to
determine
which
class
a
given
piece
of
text
should
belong
to,
looking
for
clues
in
the
form
of
semantically
relevant
text
elements.
Every
rule
has
a
pattern
that
the
text
must
match
to
be
placed
into
the
corresponding
category.
To
be
more
concrete,
let’s
say
you
wanted
to
design
a
text
classifier
capable
of
distinguishing
common
topics
of
conversation,
like
the
weather,
movies,
or
food.
In
order
to
enable
your
text
classifier
to
recognize
discussion
of
the
weather,
you
might
tell
it
to
look
for
weather-related
words
in
the
body
of
the
text
samples
it
is
being
fed.
You’d
have
a
list
of
keywords,
phrases,
and
other
relevant
patterns
that
could
be
used
to
distinguish
the
topic.
For
instance,
you
might
instruct
the
classifier
to
look
for
words
like
“wind”,
“rain”,
“sun”,
“snow”,
or 
“cloud”.
You
could
then
have
the
classifier
look
through
input
text
and
count
the
number
of
times
that
these
words
appear
in
the
body
of
the
text
and
if
they
appear
more
commonly
than
words
related
to
movies,
you
would
classify
the
text
as
belonging
to
the
weather
class.
The
advantage
of
rules-based
systems
is
that
their
inputs
and
outputs
are
predictable
and
interpretable
by
humans,
and
they
can
be
improved
through
manual
intervention
by
the
engineer.
However,
rules-based
classification
methods
are
also
somewhat
brittle,
and
they
often
have
a
difficult
time
generalizing
because
they
can
only
adhere
to
the
predefined
patterns
that
have
been
programmed
in.
As
an
example,
the
word
“cloud”
could
refer
to
moisture
in
the
sky,
or
it
could
be
referring
to
a
digital
cloud
where
data
is
stored.
It’s
difficult
for
rules-based
systems
to
handle
these
nuances
without
the
engineers
spending
a
fair
amount
of
time
trying
to
manually
anticipate
and
adjust
for
these
subtleties.
Machine
Learning
Systems
As
mentioned
above,
rules-based
systems
have
limitations,
as
their
functions
and
rules
must
be
pre-programmed.
By
contrast,
machine
learning-based
classification
systems
operate
by
applying
algorithms
that
analyze
datasets
for
patterns
that
are
associated
with
a
particular
class.
Machine
learning
algorithms
are
fed
pre-labeled/pre-classified
instances
that
are
analyzed
for
relevant
features.
These
pre-labeled
instances
are
the
training
data.
The
machine
learning
classifier
analyzes
the
training
data
and
learns
patterns
that
are
associated
with
the
different
classes.
After
this,
unseen
instances
are
stripped
of
their
labels
and
fed
to
the
classification
algorithm
which
assigns
the
instances
a
label.
The
assigned
labels
are
then
compared
to
the
original
labels
to
see
how
accurate
the
machine
learning
classifier
was,
gauging
how
well
the
model
learned
what
patterns
predict
which
classes.
Machine
learning
algorithms
operate
by
analyzing
numerical
data.
This
means
that
in
order
to
use
a
machine
learning
algorithm
on
text
data,
the
text
needs
to
be
converted
into
a
numerical
format.
There
are
various
methods
of
encoding
text
data
as
numerical
data
and
creating
machine
learning
methods
around
this
data.
We’ll
cover
some
of
the
different
ways
to
represent
text
data
below.
Bag-of-Words
Bag-of-words
is
one
of
the
most
commonly
used
approaches
for
encoding
and
representing
text
data.
The
term
“bag-of-words”
comes
from
the
fact
that
you
essentially
take
all
the
words
in
the
documents
and
put
them
all
into
one
“bag”
without
paying
attention
to
word
order
or
grammar,
paying
attention
only
to
the
frequency
of
words
in
the
bag.
This
results
in
a
long
array,
or
vector,
containing
a
single
representation
of
all
the
words
in
the
input
documents.
So
if
there
are
10000
unique
words
total
in
the
input
documents,
the
feature
vectors
will
be
10000
words
long.
This
is
how
the
size
of
the
word
bag/feature
vector
is
calculated.

After
the
feature
vector
size
has
been
determined,
every
document
in
the
list
of
total
documents
is
assigned
its
own
vector
filled
with
numbers
that
indicate
how
many
times
the
word
in
question
appears
in
the
current
document.
This
means
that
if
the
word
“food”
appears
eight
times
within
one
text
document,
that
corresponding
feature
vector/feature
array
will
have
an
eight
in
the
corresponding
position.
Put
another
way,
all
the
unique
words
that
appear
in
the
input
documents
are
all
piled
into
one
bag
and
then
each
document
gets
a
word
vector
of
the
same
size,
which
is
then
filled
in
with
the
number
of
times
the
different
words
appear
in
the
document.
Text
datasets
will
often
contain
a
large
number
of
unique
words,
but
most
of
them
aren’t
used
very
frequently.
For
this
reason,
the
number
of
words
used
to
create
the
word
vector
is
typically
capped
at
a
chosen
value
(N)
and
then
the
feature
vector
dimension
will
be
Nx1.
Term
Frequency-Inverse
Document
Frequency
(TF-IDF)
Another
way
to
represent
a
document
based
on
the
words
in
it
is
dubbed
Term
Frequency-Inverse
Document
Frequency
(TF-IDF)
.
A
TF-IDF
approach
also
creates
a
vector
that
represents
the
document
based
on
the
words
in
it,
but
unlike
Bag-of-words
these
words
are
weighted
by
more
than
just
their
frequency
.
TF-IDF
considers
the
importance
of
the
words
in
the
documents,
attempting
to
quantify
how
relevant
that
word
is
to
the
subject
of
the
document.
In
other
words,
TF-IDF
analyzes
relevance
instead
of
frequency
and
the
word
counts
in
a
feature
vector
are
replaced
by
a
TF-IDF
score
that
is
calculated
with
regard
to
the
whole
dataset.
A
TF-IDF
approach
operates
by
first
calculating
the
term
frequency,
the
number
of
times
that
the
unique
terms
appear
within
a
specific
document.
However,
TF-IDF
also
takes
care
to
limit
the
influence
that
extremely
common
words
like
“the”,
“or”,
and
“and”,
as
these
“stopwords”
are
very
common
yet
convey
very
little
information
about
the
content
of
the
document.
These
words
need
to
be
discounted,
which
is
what
the
“inverse-document
frequency”
part
of
TF-IDF
refers
to.
This
is
done
is
because
the
more
documents
that
a
specific
words
shows
up
in,
the
less
useful
that
word
is
in
distinguishing
it
from
the
other
documents
in
the
list
of
all
documents.
The
formula
that
TF-IDF
uses
to
calculate
the
importance
of
a
word
is
designed
to
preserve
the
words
that
are
the
most
frequent
and
the
most
semantically
rich.
The
feature
vectors
created
by
the
TF-IDF
approach
contain
normalized
values
that
sum
to
one,
assigning
each
word
a
weighted
value
as
calculated
by
the
TF-IDF
formula.
Word
Embeddings
Word
embeddings
are
methods
of
representing
text
that
ensure
that
words
with
similar
meanings
have
similar
numerical
representations.
Word
embeddings
operate
by
“vectorizing”
words
,
meaning
that
they
represent
words
as
real-valued-vectors
in
a
vector
space.
The
vectors
exist
in
a
grid
or
matrix,
and
they
have
a
direction
and
length
(or
magnitude).
When
representing
words
as
vectors,
the
words
are
converted
into
vectors
comprised
of
real
values.
Every
word
is
mapped
to
one
vector,
and
words
that
are
similar
in
meaning
have
similar
direction
and
magnitude.
This
type
of
encoding
makes
it
possible
for
a
machine
learning
algorithm
to
learn
complicated
relationships
between
words.
The
embeddings
that
represent
different
words
are
created
with
regard
to
how
the
words
in
question
are
used.
Because
words
that
are
used
in
similar
ways
will
have
similar
vectors,
the
process
of
creating
word
embeddings
automatically
translates
some
of
the
meaning
the
words
have.
A
bag
of
words
approach,
by
contrast,
creates
brittle
representations
where
different
words
will
have
dissimilar
representations
even
if
they
are
used
in
highly
similar
contexts.
As
a
result,
word
embeddings
are
better
at
capturing
the
context
of
words
within
a
sentence.
There
are
different
algorithms
and
approaches
used
to
create
word
embeddings.
Some
of
the
most
common
and
reliable
word
embedding
methods
include:
embedding
layers,
word2vec,
and
GloVe.
Embedding
Layers
One
potential
way
to
use
word
embeddings
alongside
a
machine
learning/
deep
learning
system
is
to
use
an
embedding
layer
.
Embedding
layers
are
deep
learning
layers
that
convert
words
into
embeddings
which
is
then
fed
into
the
rest
of
the
deep
learning
system.
The
word
embeddings
are
learned
as
the
network
trains
for
a
specific
text-based
task.
In
a
word
embedding
approach,
similar
words
will
have
similar
representations
and
be
closer
to
each
other
than
to
dissimilar
words.
In
order
to
use
embedding
layers,
the
text
needs
to
be
preprocessed
first.
The
text
in
the
document
has
to
be
one-hot
encoded,
and
the
vector
size
needs
to
be
specified
in
advance.
The
one-hot
text
is
then
converted
to
word
vectors
and
the
vectors
are
passed
into
the
machine
learning
model.
Word2Vec
Word2Vec
is
another
common
method
of
embedding
words.
Word2Vec
uses
statistical
methods
to
convert
words
to
embeddings
and
it
is
optimized
for
use
with
neural
network
based
models.
Word2Vec
was
developed
by
Google
researchers
and
it
is
one
of
the
most
commonly
used
embedding
methods,
as
it
reliably
yields
useful,
rich
embeddings.
Word2Vec
representations
are
useful
for
identifying
semantic
and
syntactic
commonalities
in
language.
This
means
that
Word2Vec
representations
capture
relationships
between
similar
concepts,
being
able
to
distinguish
that
the
commonality
between
“King”
and
“Queen”
is
royalty
and
that
“King”
implies
“man-ness”
while
Queen
implies
“Woman-ness”.
GloVe
GloVE,
or
Global
Vector
for
Word
Representation
,
builds
upon
the
embedding
algorithms
used
by
Word2Vec.
GloVe
embedding
methods
combine
aspects
of
both
Word2Vec
and
matrix
factorization
techniques
like
Latent
Semantic
Analysis.
The
advantage
of
Word2Vec
is
that
it
can
capture
context,
but
as
a
tradeoff
it
poorly
captures
global
text
statistics.
Conversely,
traditional
vector
representations
are
good
at
determining
global
text
statistics
but
they
aren’t
useful
for
determining
the
context
of
words
and
phrases.
GloVE
draws
from
the
best
of
both
approaches,
creating
word-context
based
on
global
text
statistics.
