that

affect
our
editors'
opinions
or
evaluations.
Student
loan
refinancing
can
mean
big
savings
in
the
right
circumstances.
Here’s
how
it
works:
A
new
private
company—typically
a
bank,
credit
union
or
online
lender—pays
off
the
student
loans
you
choose
to
refinance,
and
you’ll
get
a
new
loan
with
an
interest
rate
tied
to
your
credit
history,
income
and
other
characteristics.
You
should
consider
student
loan
refinancing
if
you
have
a
good
or
excellent
credit
score
and
stable
income
(or
a
co-signer
who
does)
and
your
current
loans
have
high
enough
interest
rates
that
you’ll
benefit
from
a
lower
rate.
In
some
cases,
you
can
even
refinance
federal
PLUS
loans
your
parents
took
out
to
help
you
pay
for
college,
relieving
them
of
payment
responsibility.
Below
we’ve
identified
the
best
student
loan
refinance
lenders
for
those
who
qualify,
based
on
features
including
interest
rates,
availability
to
borrowers
and
hardship
repayment
options.
None
of
the
lenders
on
our
list
charge
origination
or
prepayment
fees,
though
some
charge
late
fees.
In
some
cases,
they
offer
a
separate
refinancing
product
for
parent
loan
borrowers;
we
scored
each
based
on
their
student
loan
refinancing
option
only.

Why
We
Picked
It
CommonBond
offers
a
solid
all-around
refinance
product
with
a
rare
24
months
of
forbearance
for
borrowers
experiencing
financial
hardship.
Graduates
also
have
the
option
to
refinance
their
parents’
federal
PLUS
loans
in
their
own
names.
CommonBond
also
is
unique
in
that
it
offers
a
hybrid
loan
option,
which
charges
a
fixed
interest
rate
for
the
first
five
years
of
a
10-year
loan
term,
then
a
variable
rate
for
the
following
five
years.
That
could
be
a
smart
bet
for
borrowers
who
plan
to
repay
their
loans
early
but
want
some
assurance
their
rates
won’t
increase
in
the
short
term.
Borrowers
may
also
get
a
lower
rate
on
the
hybrid
loan
than
on
CommonBond’s
10-year
fixed-rate
loan.

Why
We
Picked
It
PenFed,
short
for
Pentagon
Federal
Credit
Union,
offers
student
loan
refinancing
through
a
partnership
with
Purefy,
an
online-only
student
loan
provider.
It
stands
out
for
its
low
rates
and
flexibility:
Graduates
can
refinance
their
parent’s
PLUS
loans
and
take
on
repayment
responsibility,
and
spouses
can
refinance
their
separate
student
loans
into
a
single
loan.
Co-signer
release
also
can
take
place
earlier
than
any
other
lender
on
our
list
offers.
That
means
your
co-signer
could
be
free
of
repayment
responsibility
sooner,
limiting
the
risk
they
take
on
by
co-borrowing
with
you.
You’ll
have
to
become
a
member
of
PenFed
Credit
Union
in
order
to
refinance
once
you’ve
been
preapproved
for
a
loan,
but
there
are
no
restrictions
on
membership
for
refinance
customers
and
there’s
a
nominal
cost
to
join.
You’ll
then
have
access
to
other
financial
products
as
a
PenFed
member.

Why
We
Picked
It
SoFi
allows
borrowers
with
an
associate’s
degree
to
refinance,
which
opens
up
eligibility
to
a
wider
range
of
applicants.
(We
believe
the
ability
to
refinance
without
a
bachelor’s
degree
is
an
important
feature
of
a
refinance
loan;
seven
of
the
10
lenders
on
our
list
offer
it.)
Also,
it’s
one
of
four
lenders
on
our
list
that
does
not
place
a
limit
on
the
amount
you
can
refinance.
It’s
possible
to
refinance
up
to
the
total
balance
of
your
loans,
which
is
helpful
for
those
with
a
lot
of
debt
from
professional
degrees.
SoFi’s
rates
aren’t
as
low
as
some
other
lenders’,
and
it
doesn’t
offer
co-signer
release,
which
is
unusual
among
our
top
picks.
But
as
a
SoFi
customer,
you’ll
get
access
to
benefits
like
a
0.125%
interest
rate
discount
on
certain
additional
SoFi
products,
such
as
personal
loans
and
career
coaching.

Why
We
Picked
It
The
Massachusetts
Educational
Financing
Authority,
known
as
MEFA,
is
a
nonprofit,
state-based
agency
that
offers
student
loan
refinancing
to
customers
across
the
country.
It
does
not
require
borrowers
to
have
a
degree,
so
those
who
did
not
graduate
can
refinance.
It
also
doesn’t
charge
fees,
including
late
fees.
While
MEFA
does
not
advertise
a
specific
forbearance
limit,
the
agency
says
it
will
work
with
borrowers
to
modify
their
payment
plans
if
necessary
due
to
financial
hardship.
Since
the
fixed
and
variable
rates
offered
are
currently
the
same,
your
best
bet
is
to
pick
a
fixed-rate
loan
so
you
know
it
won’t
increase
in
the
future.

Tips
for
Comparing
Student
Loan
Refinance
Lenders
Since
the
goal
of
refinancing
is
to
save
money
on
interest,
you’ll
likely
want
to
choose
the
lender
that
offers
you
the
lowest
rate
you
qualify
for.
Variable
rates
tend
to
be
lower
than
fixed
rates,
but
they
could
go
up
in
the
future;
only
opt
for
a
variable
rate
if
you
plan
to
pay
off
your
loan
quickly.
Similar
to
private
student
loans
for
those
attending
school,
refinance
loans
aren’t
required
to
offer
the
same
consumer
protections
that
federal
loans
do,
such
as
income-driven
repayment
plans
or
forgiveness
.
But
some
refinance
lenders
provide
more
than
the
standard
12
months
of
forbearance
throughout
the
loan
term,
and/or
additional
loan
modification
options
for
borrowers
having
difficulty
making
payments.
Refinancing
is
typically
best
for
those
with
strong
incomes
and
job
stability.
But
life
is
unpredictable.
If
you
think
you
might
need
to
take
a
pause
from
payments
or
to
lower
your
monthly
bill,
consider
choosing
a
lender
with
a
more
generous
forbearance
policy.
Also,
if
you
choose
to
refinance
with
the
help
of
a
co-signer,
go
with
a
lender
that
offers
a
co-signer
release
policy
so
you
can
take
on
the
full
repayment
obligation
when
possible.
That
will
protect
your
co-signer’s
credit
from
the
negative
marks
that
could
occur
if
you
fall
behind
on
payments.
Methodology
We
requested
data
from
16
lenders
that
dominate
the
student
loan
refinance
market
and
scored
them
across
15
data
points
in
the
categories
of
interest
rates,
fees,
loan
terms,
hardship
options,
application
process
and
eligibility.
We
chose
the
10
best
to
display
based
on
those
earning
three
stars
or
higher.
The
following
is
the
weighting
assigned
to
each
category:
Hardship
options:
30%
Eligibility:
18%
Loan
terms:
18%
Application
process:
16%
Interest
rates:
13%
Fees:
5%
Specific
characteristics
taken
into
consideration
within
each
category
included
number
of
months
of
forbearance
available,
hardship
repayment
options
beyond
traditional
forbearance,
availability
of
in-school
deferment,
accessibility
to
borrowers
without
a
bachelor’s
degree,
time
to
default,
disclosure
of
credit
score
and
income
requirements
and
other
factors.
Lenders
who
offered
interest
rates
below
7%
scored
the
highest,
as
did
those
who
offered
more
than
the
standard
12
months
of
forbearance,
who
offered
interest
rate
discounts
beyond
the
standard
0.25%
for
automatic
payments,
who
charged
no
late
fees
and
who
offered
multiple
loan
terms
maxing
out
at
15
years.
We
believe
that
to
take
full
advantage
of
refinancing,
borrowers
should
choose
the
shortest
loan
term
available,
and
a
20-year
term
has
the
potential
to
limit
interest
savings.
In
some
cases,
lenders
were
awarded
partial
points,
and
a
maximum
of
3%
of
the
final
score
was
left
to
editorial
discretion
based
on
the
quality
of
consumer-friendly
features
offered.
Frequently
Asked
Questions
How
do
I
know
if
student
loan
refinancing
is
right
for
me?
The
three
items
to
consider
when
deciding
whether
to
refinance
are
financial
history,
interest
rates
and
repayment
goals.
&nbsp;
First
identify
whether
you
qualify;
of
the
lenders
that
disclosed
their
minimum
credit
scores
to
Forbes
Advisor,
all
had
a
minimum
credit
score
of
650
or
higher.
You’ll
also
generally
need
to
show
stable
income,
a
low
debt-to-income
ratio
and
a
history
of
on-time
debt
payments.
&nbsp;
Eligible
to
refinance?
Now
look
at
your
current
loans’
interest
rates.
If
they’re
meaningfully
higher
than
the
rate
you’ll
likely
get
when
you
refinance—which
you
can
check
using
lenders’
prequalification
tools
on
their
websites—refinancing
might
make
sense
for
you.
But
if
you
don’t
stand
to
save
much,
or
you
are
relying
on
federal
programs
like
Public
Service
Loan
Forgiveness
that
you’d
lose
by
refinancing,
it’s
not
worth
it.
Which
student
loans
should
I
refinance?
Your
safest
bet
is
to
refinance
high-interest
private
loans.
That’s
because
you
won’t
lose
potentially
useful
federal
repayment
options,
including
up
to
three
years
of
deferment
or
forbearance
,
since
private
loans
usually
come
with
less
generous
repayment
terms.
&nbsp;
Under
the
CARES
Act,
which
was
passed
in
response
to
the
coronavirus
(Covid-19)
pandemic,
and
President
Donald
Trump’s
Aug.
8
executive
order,
federal
student
loan
borrowers
have
an
additional
forbearance
option:
They
do
not
have
to
make
payments
from
March
13
through
Dec.
31,
2021,
and
federal
student
loan
interest
rates
are
set
at
0%
during
that
time.
&nbsp;
You
do
not
have
to
refinance
all
of
your
loans,
so
consider
keeping
federal
loans
federal
and
leaving
them
out
of
your
refinance
package.
&nbsp;
If
you
do
not
plan
to
make
use
of
any
federal
loan
benefits—or
you
want
to
refinance
so
that
you
can
pay
off
loans
very
quickly—it’s
possible
to
refinance
federal
loans.
Consider
doing
so,
though,
after
the
Covid-19
monthly
payment
pause
has
ended.
When
is
the
best
time
to
refinance
student
loans?
Many
lenders
require
a
degree
in
order
to
refinance,
so
it’s
best
to
wait
until
you’ve
graduated.
Some
lenders
have
more
relaxed
degree
requirements,
but
they
may
want
to
see
a
history
of
on-time
student
loan
payments
for
a
period
of
time
first
(say,
12
months).
You
also
typically
must
be
out
of
school
before
refinancing,
with
some
exceptions.
&nbsp;
If
you
don’t
yet
meet
the
credit
and
income
requirements
but
you
want
to
refinance
anyway,
it’s
possible
to
use
a
co-signer.
Due
to
the
risk
to
their
credit
score
the
co-signer
takes
on,
though,
it’s
ideal
to
wait
to
refinance
until
you
have
the
financial
profile
to
be
eligible
as
the
sole
borrower.
You
can
take
the
time
to
improve
your
credit
score
and
refinance
later
on.
What
is
‘co-signer
release?’
Some
refinance
lenders
offer
to
release
the
co-signer
from
a
loan
after
the
borrower
makes
a
certain
number
of
payments.
That
can
protect
the
co-signer
from
a
credit
hit
as
a
result
of
the
primary
borrower’s
negative
payment
history.
If
you
plan
to
use
co-signer
release,
check
your
loan
documents
to
see
when
it
will
be
possible
(in
36
months,
for
instance)
and
what
additional
requirements
you
might
need
to
meet.

The
Forbes
Advisor
editorial
team
is
independent
and
objective.
To
help
support
our
reporting
work,
and
to
continue
our
ability
to
provide
this
content
for
free
to
our
readers,
we
receive
compensation
from
the
companies
that
advertise
on
the
Forbes
Advisor
site.
This
compensation
comes
from
two
main
sources.
First
,
we
provide
paid
placements
to
advertisers
to
present
their
offers.
The
compensation
we
receive
for
those
placements
affects
how
and
where
advertisers’
offers
appear
on
the
site.
This
site
does
not
include
all
companies
or
products
available
within
the
market.
Second,
we
also
include
links
to
advertisers’
offers
in
some
of
our
articles;
these
“affiliate
links”
may
generate
income
for
our
site
when
you
click
on
them.
The
compensation
we
receive
from
advertisers
does
not
influence
the
recommendations
or
advice
our
editorial
team
provides
in
our
articles
or
otherwise
impact
any
of
the
editorial
content
on
Forbes
Advisor.
While
we
work
hard
to
provide
accurate
and
up
to
date
information
that
we
think
you
will
find
relevant,
Forbes
Advisor
does
not
and
cannot
guarantee
that
any
information
provided
is
complete
and
makes
no
representations
or
warranties
in
connection
thereto,
nor
to
the
accuracy
or
applicability
thereof.
Here
is
a
list
of
our
partners
who
offer
products
that
we
have
affiliate
links
for.
