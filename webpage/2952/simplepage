WHY WE PICKED IT Read More SCROLL TO SITE advisor loans Advertiser Disclosure Updated: Jan 5, 2021, 6:09am Best Student Loan Refinance Lenders 2021 Brianna McGurran Editor Updated: Jan 5, 2021, 6:09am Editorial Note: Forbes may earn a commission on sales made from partner links on this page, but that doesn't affect our editors' opinions or evaluations. Student loan refinancing can mean big savings in the right circumstances. Here’s how it works: A new private company—typically a bank, credit union or online lender—pays off the student loans you choose to refinance, and you’ll get a new loan with an interest rate tied to your credit history, income and other characteristics. You should consider student loan refinancing if you have a good or excellent credit score and stable income (or a co-signer who does) and your current loans have high enough interest rates that you’ll benefit from a lower rate. In some cases, you can even refinance federal PLUS loans your parents took out to help you pay for college, relieving them of payment responsibility. Below we’ve identified the best student loan refinance lenders for those who qualify, based on features including interest rates, availability to borrowers and hardship repayment options. None of the lenders on our list charge origination or prepayment fees, though some charge late fees. In some cases, they offer a separate refinancing product for parent loan borrowers; we scored each based on their student loan refinancing option only.

All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team. Variable APR 1.97% to 6.82% Fixed APR 2.83% to 6.74% Compare Rates Via Commonbond's Secure Website Variable APR 1.97% to 6.82% Fixed APR 2.83% to 6.74% Why We Picked It CommonBond offers a solid all-around refinance product with a rare 24 months of forbearance for borrowers experiencing financial hardship. Graduates also have the option to refinance their parents’ federal PLUS loans in their own names. CommonBond also is unique in that it offers a hybrid loan option, which charges a fixed interest rate for the first five years of a 10-year loan term, then a variable rate for the following five years. That could be a smart bet for borrowers who plan to repay their loans early but want some assurance their rates won’t increase in the short term. Borrowers may also get a lower rate on the hybrid loan than on CommonBond’s 10-year fixed-rate loan. Extra Details Loan terms: 5, 7, 10, 15 or 20 years Loan amounts available: Up to $500,000 Eligibility: Bachelor’s degree required. Minimum FICO score of 680 for applicants; minimum annual income of $65,000. Forbearance options: Up to 24 months of forbearance available throughout the loan term Co-signer release policy: Available after 36 months of consecutive, on-time monthly payments. The primary borrower must meet the company’s underwriting requirements in order to take over the loan. Pros &amp; Cons Interest rate estimate available without undergoing a hard credit check Comparatively long forbearance period available Student can refinance parent PLUS loans in their own name Charges late fees Bachelor’s degree required Maximum loan term is longer than 15 years FEATURED PARTNER OFFER PenFed Credit Union 3.5 Our ratings take into account the card’s rewards, fees, rates along with the card’s category. All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team. Variable APR 2.19% to 4.49% Fixed APR 2.99% to 5.15% Compare Rates Via Credible.com's Secure Website Variable APR 2.19% to 4.49% Fixed APR 2.99% to 5.15% Why We Picked It PenFed, short for Pentagon Federal Credit Union, offers student loan refinancing through a partnership with Purefy, an online-only student loan provider. It stands out for its low rates and flexibility: Graduates can refinance their parent’s PLUS loans and take on repayment responsibility, and spouses can refinance their separate student loans into a single loan. Co-signer release also can take place earlier than any other lender on our list offers. That means your co-signer could be free of repayment responsibility sooner, limiting the risk they take on by co-borrowing with you. You’ll have to become a member of PenFed Credit Union in order to refinance once you’ve been preapproved for a loan, but there are no restrictions on membership for refinance customers and there’s a nominal cost to join. You’ll then have access to other financial products as a PenFed member. Extra Details Loan terms: 5, 8, 12 and 15 years Loan amounts available: $7,500 to $300,000 Eligibility: Bachelor’s degree required. Minimum credit score of 700 and minimum income of $42,000 if you refinance less than $150,000. (You must use a co-signer if your credit score is 670 to 699 and your income is between $25,000 and $41,999). Minimum credit score of 725 and minimum income of $50,000 if you refinance $150,000 or more. (You must use a co-signer if your credit score is 670 to 724 and your income is $25,000 to $49,999). Forbearance options: PenFed does not disclose a specific forbearance limit, but borrowers seeking repayment help have the option to receive temporary (six months or less) or permanent hardship assistance based on their circumstances. After filling out an application for assistance, PenFed says it will provide a personalized solution. Co-signer release policy: Available after 12 months of consecutive, on-time payments Pros &amp; Cons Interest rate estimate available without undergoing a hard credit check Spouses can refinance separate student loans into a single loan Co-signer release available after a comparatively short time No deferment option if borrowers go back to school Charges late fees FEATURED PARTNER OFFER SoFi 3.5 Our ratings take into account the card’s rewards, fees, rates along with the card’s category. All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team. Variable APR 2.24% to 6.09% Fixed APR 2.99% to 6.09% Learn More Via Credible.com's Secure Website Variable APR 2.24% to 6.09% Fixed APR 2.99% to 6.09% Why We Picked It SoFi allows borrowers with an associate’s degree to refinance, which opens up eligibility to a wider range of applicants. (We believe the ability to refinance without a bachelor’s degree is an important feature of a refinance loan; seven of the 10 lenders on our list offer it.) Also, it’s one of four lenders on our list that does not place a limit on the amount you can refinance. It’s possible to refinance up to the total balance of your loans, which is helpful for those with a lot of debt from professional degrees. SoFi’s rates aren’t as low as some other lenders’, and it doesn’t offer co-signer release, which is unusual among our top picks. But as a SoFi customer, you’ll get access to benefits like a 0.125% interest rate discount on certain additional SoFi products, such as personal loans and career coaching. Extra Details Loan terms: 5, 7, 10, 15 and 20 years Loan amounts available: $5,000 up to total balance of eligible loans Eligibility: Associate’s or bachelor’s degree required. Minimum credit score of 650. Does not disclose income requirements. Forbearance options: SoFi offers an Unemployment Protection Program that allows borrowers to pause payments in three-month increments, for up to 12 months, if laid off from work. A separate forbearance program is also available for borrowers experiencing other types of economic hardship, such as medical expenses. Borrowers can take up to 12 months total forbearance, no matter which program they use. Co-signer release policy: None Pros &amp; Cons Interest rate estimate available without undergoing a hard credit check Borrowers can refinance with an associate’s degree Access to SoFi member benefits, including career coaching No co-signer release available Charges late fees Maximum loan term is longer than 15 years FEATURED PARTNER OFFER MEFA 3.5 Our ratings take into account the card’s rewards, fees, rates along with the card’s category. All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team. Variable APR 3.05% to 5.55% Fixed APR 3.05% to 5.55% Compare Rates Via Credible.com's Secure Website Variable APR 3.05% to 5.55% Fixed APR 3.05% to 5.55% Why We Picked It The Massachusetts Educational Financing Authority, known as MEFA, is a nonprofit, state-based agency that offers student loan refinancing to customers across the country. It does not require borrowers to have a degree, so those who did not graduate can refinance. It also doesn’t charge fees, including late fees. While MEFA does not advertise a specific forbearance limit, the agency says it will work with borrowers to modify their payment plans if necessary due to financial hardship. Since the fixed and variable rates offered are currently the same, your best bet is to pick a fixed-rate loan so you know it won’t increase in the future. Extra Details Loan terms: 7, 10 and 15 years Loan amounts available: $10,000 minimum; no maximum Eligibility: No degree required. Minimum FICO score of 670 and minimum income of $24,000 for each loan applicant. Forbearance options: No specific policy except in the case of natural disasters or other extenuating circumstances. Loan modification program available on a case-by-case basis to borrowers who need long-term help. Co-signer release policy: None Pros &amp; Cons Interest rate estimate available without undergoing a hard credit check No late fees Borrowers can refinance without a degree Shortest loan term is 7 years No co-signer release available FEATURED PARTNER OFFER Citizens Bank 3.5 Our ratings take into account the card’s rewards, fees, rates along with the card’s category.

It also offers co-signer release after 36 loan payments. The high end of Citizens Bank student loan refinancing rates is quite high compared with other lenders on our list. But borrowers can qualify for an interest rate discount of up to 0.50% if they have an existing account with the bank. (Refinancing is available nationwide, but checking and savings accounts are only available in Connecticut, Delaware, Massachusetts, Michigan, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and Vermont.) Extra Details Loan terms: 5, 7, 10, 15 and 20 years Loan amounts available: $10,000 to $300,000 (for those with a bachelor’s degrees or less) or $500,000 (for those with a graduate degree) Eligibility: No degree required. Borrowers with no degree or an associate’s degree must show that they have made 12 on-time payments after leaving school in order to refinance. Minimum income $24,000 for borrower and co-signer combined. Forbearance options: Three months of forbearance available at a time up to an undisclosed limit. Borrowers experiencing a long-term financial hardship can participate in a loan modification program for up to 12 months. Co-signer release policy: Available after 36 on-time payments Pros &amp; Cons Interest rate estimate available without undergoing a hard credit check No degree required Up to 0.50% interest rate discount available for existing Citizens Bank customers Maximum APR is above 7% No forbearance limit disclosed Maximum loan term is longer than 15 years FEATURED PARTNER OFFER Rhode Island Student Loan Authority 3.5 Our ratings take into account the card’s rewards, fees, rates along with the card’s category. All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team. Variable APR N/A Fixed APR 3.49% to 8.14% Compare Rates Via Credible.com's Secure Website Variable APR N/A Fixed APR 3.49% to 8.14% Why We Picked It Rhode Island Student Loan Authority, or RISLA, is a Rhode Island-based nonprofit that refinances loans for customers across the country. It stands apart for its income-based repayment program, which limits payments to 15% of income for a 25-year period if borrowers can’t afford their payments. That’s an extremely rare perk in the student loan refinance market. But RISLA scored lower than other lenders because it doesn’t provide a co-signer release policy, it charges late fees and its maximum APR is higher than 7%. RISLA only offers fixed interest rates. Extra Details Loan terms: 5, 10 and 15 years Loan amounts available: $7,500 to $250,000, depending on the degree earned Eligibility: No degree required. Minimum credit score 680 and minimum income of $40,000. Forbearance options: Up to 12 months of forbearance available, in three-month increments Co-signer release policy: None Pros &amp; Cons Income-based repayment plan available No degree required Interest rate estimate available without undergoing a hard credit check No co-signer release available Maximum APR is above 7% FEATURED PARTNER OFFER Laurel Road 3.0 Our ratings take into account the card’s rewards, fees, rates along with the card’s category.

Variable APR 1.89% to 5.90% Fixed APR 2.80% to 6.00% Variable APR 1.89% to 5.90% Fixed APR 2.80% to 6.00% Why We Picked It Laurel Road, an online-only lender acquired by KeyBank in 2019, offers some perks specific to borrowers who work in health care. Graduate students and those pursuing bachelor’s degrees in health professions (and, if pursuing an associate’s degree, those in certain health care specialties) can refinance as early as their final semester of school if they have an employment offer. Undergraduates in other fields can refinance after 12 months of employment. Borrowers also can release their co-signers after 36 monthly payments, and graduates can refinance federal PLUS loans in their own names that their parents took out. Extra Details Loan terms: 5, 7, 10, 15 and 20 years Loan amounts available: $5,000 minimum; no maximum, except for associate’s degree graduates, who can refinance up to $50,000. Eligibility: Must have a degree from an eligible institution. Associate’s degree graduates can refinance if they work in certain health care fields. Laurel Road does not disclose credit score or income requirements. Forbearance options: Up to 12 months of forbearance available, in three-month increments Co-signer release policy: After 36 consecutive, on-time payments Pros &amp; Cons Borrowers in certain fields can refinance with an associate’s degree Some borrowers can refinance during their final semester of school Interest rate estimate available without undergoing a hard credit check Charges late fees No deferment option if borrowers go back to school Maximum loan term is longer than 15 years FEATURED PARTNER OFFER Earnest 3.0 Our ratings take into account the card’s rewards, fees, rates along with the card’s category.

Variable APR 1.99% to 5.74% Fixed APR 2.98% to 5.89% Variable APR 1.99% to 5.74% Fixed APR 2.98% to 5.89% Why We Picked It Earnest offers several unique features, including the option to make automatic payments twice a month to accelerate repayment and the choice of any repayment term between five and 20 years. It also offers a solid range of hardship repayment options beyond the standard 12 months of forbearance, such as the ability to skip one monthly bill every year. Borrowers cannot apply with a co-signer, so you must be able to meet the credit requirements on your own. Earnest did not disclose the amount of time before unpaid loans go into default . Extra Details Loan terms: Choose any term between five and 20 years. Your options may depend on your financial profile. Loan amounts available: $5,000 ($10,000 for California residents) to $500,000 Eligibility: Borrowers must have completed a degree at an eligible nonprofit school and have a minimum credit score of 650. They must also meet other criteria, including having savings of at least two months’ worth of expenses, on-time payment history and no bankruptcies. Forbearance options: Up to 12 months of forbearance available (after making three consecutive, timely payments toward the loan). Borrowers can also skip one payment every 12 months (after making six consecutive, timely payments) and get an interest rate and/or term modification in the event of long-term financial hardship. Co-signer release policy: None Pros &amp; Cons Borrowers with an associate’s degree can refinance Wide variety of repayment terms No late fees No option to apply with a co-signer Maximum loan term is longer than 15 years FEATURED PARTNER OFFER PNC Bank 3.0 Our ratings take into account the card’s rewards, fees, rates along with the card’s category. All ratings are determined solely by our editorial team. Variable APR 1.12% to 3.92% Fixed APR 3.44% to 6.24% Variable APR 1.12% to 3.92% Fixed APR 3.44% to 6.24% Why We Picked It PNC Bank offers a particularly generous interest rate discount of 0.50% to borrowers who make monthly payments automatically from a bank account. It also doesn’t require refinance borrowers to have a degree, but you must have made at least 24 months’ worth of payments toward existing student loans to qualify. You must also show two years of income history. PNC Bank allows co-signers to come off the loan after 48 months of payments, which is longer than what other lenders that provide co-signer release offer. Extra Details Loan terms: 5, 10 and 15 years Loan amounts available: $10,000 to $75,000 Eligibility: Two years of income and employment history required. PNC Bank does not disclose minimum credit score or income requirements. Forbearance options: Up to 12 months of forbearance available, in two-month increments. Borrowers must make full payments for at least 12 months between forbearance periods. Co-signer release policy: Available after 48 months of consecutive, on-time payments Pros &amp; Cons Interest rate discount of 0.50% for automatic payments No degree required No interest rate estimate available without hard inquiry Co-signer release available after a longer time period than other lenders provide FEATURED PARTNER OFFER Discover 3.0 Our ratings take into account the card’s rewards, fees, rates along with the card’s category.

Variable APR 1.87% to 5.87% Fixed APR 3.49% to 6.99% Variable APR 1.87% to 5.87% Fixed APR 3.49% to 6.99% Why We Picked It Discover doesn’t require borrowers to have graduated in order to refinance. It also offers a range of hardship repayment options beyond the traditional 12 months of forbearance for refinance borrowers in need. A three-month payment suspension is available for borrowers early in their repayment term, and borrowers also can seek a reduced payment or reduced interest rate for six months in certain circumstances. Discover doesn’t provide a co-signer release program, and applicants must choose between 10- and 20-year terms, which is more restrictive than what most other lenders offer. But refinance customers can always prepay their loans, fee-free, to save on interest. Extra Details Loan terms: 10 or 20 years Loan amounts available: $5,000 up to total student loan debt balance, pending credit approval Eligibility: No degree required. Borrowers must not have more than $150,000 in total student loan debt (except for those with certain degree types). Discover does not disclose credit score and income requirements. Forbearance options: Up to 12 months of forbearance available. Additional repayment assistance includes interest rate reduction or monthly payment reduction plans for borrowers experiencing financial hardship. Co-signer release policy: None Pros &amp; Cons No late fees No degree required Multiple hardship repayment options Only two loan terms available No co-signer release available Maximum loan term is longer than 15 years Tips for Comparing Student Loan Refinance Lenders Since the goal of refinancing is to save money on interest, you’ll likely want to choose the lender that offers you the lowest rate you qualify for. Variable rates tend to be lower than fixed rates, but they could go up in the future; only opt for a variable rate if you plan to pay off your loan quickly. Similar to private student loans for those attending school, refinance loans aren’t required to offer the same consumer protections that federal loans do, such as income-driven repayment plans or forgiveness . But some refinance lenders provide more than the standard 12 months of forbearance throughout the loan term, and/or additional loan modification options for borrowers having difficulty making payments. Refinancing is typically best for those with strong incomes and job stability. But life is unpredictable. If you think you might need to take a pause from payments or to lower your monthly bill, consider choosing a lender with a more generous forbearance policy. Also, if you choose to refinance with the help of a co-signer, go with a lender that offers a co-signer release policy so you can take on the full repayment obligation when possible. That will protect your co-signer’s credit from the negative marks that could occur if you fall behind on payments. Methodology We requested data from 16 lenders that dominate the student loan refinance market and scored them across 15 data points in the categories of interest rates, fees, loan terms, hardship options, application process and eligibility. We chose the 10 best to display based on those earning three stars or higher. The following is the weighting assigned to each category: Hardship options: 30% Eligibility: 18% Loan terms: 18% Application process: 16% Interest rates: 13% Fees: 5% Specific characteristics taken into consideration within each category included number of months of forbearance available, hardship repayment options beyond traditional forbearance, availability of in-school deferment, accessibility to borrowers without a bachelor’s degree, time to default, disclosure of credit score and income requirements and other factors. Lenders who offered interest rates below 7% scored the highest, as did those who offered more than the standard 12 months of forbearance, who offered interest rate discounts beyond the standard 0.25% for automatic payments, who charged no late fees and who offered multiple loan terms maxing out at 15 years. We believe that to take full advantage of refinancing, borrowers should choose the shortest loan term available, and a 20-year term has the potential to limit interest savings. In some cases, lenders were awarded partial points, and a maximum of 3% of the final score was left to editorial discretion based on the quality of consumer-friendly features offered. Frequently Asked Questions How do I know if student loan refinancing is right for me? The three items to consider when deciding whether to refinance are financial history, interest rates and repayment goals. &nbsp; First identify whether you qualify; of the lenders that disclosed their minimum credit scores to Forbes Advisor, all had a minimum credit score of 650 or higher. You’ll also generally need to show stable income, a low debt-to-income ratio and a history of on-time debt payments. &nbsp; Eligible to refinance? Now look at your current loans’ interest rates. If they’re meaningfully higher than the rate you’ll likely get when you refinance—which you can check using lenders’ prequalification tools on their websites—refinancing might make sense for you. But if you don’t stand to save much, or you are relying on federal programs like Public Service Loan Forgiveness that you’d lose by refinancing, it’s not worth it. Which student loans should I refinance? Your safest bet is to refinance high-interest private loans. That’s because you won’t lose potentially useful federal repayment options, including up to three years of deferment or forbearance , since private loans usually come with less generous repayment terms. &nbsp; Under the CARES Act, which was passed in response to the coronavirus (Covid-19) pandemic, and President Donald Trump’s Aug. 8 executive order, federal student loan borrowers have an additional forbearance option: They do not have to make payments from March 13 through Dec. 31, 2021, and federal student loan interest rates are set at 0% during that time. &nbsp; You do not have to refinance all of your loans, so consider keeping federal loans federal and leaving them out of your refinance package. &nbsp; If you do not plan to make use of any federal loan benefits—or you want to refinance so that you can pay off loans very quickly—it’s possible to refinance federal loans. Consider doing so, though, after the Covid-19 monthly payment pause has ended. When is the best time to refinance student loans? Many lenders require a degree in order to refinance, so it’s best to wait until you’ve graduated. Some lenders have more relaxed degree requirements, but they may want to see a history of on-time student loan payments for a period of time first (say, 12 months). You also typically must be out of school before refinancing, with some exceptions. &nbsp; If you don’t yet meet the credit and income requirements but you want to refinance anyway, it’s possible to use a co-signer. Due to the risk to their credit score the co-signer takes on, though, it’s ideal to wait to refinance until you have the financial profile to be eligible as the sole borrower. You can take the time to improve your credit score and refinance later on. What is ‘co-signer release?’ Some refinance lenders offer to release the co-signer from a loan after the borrower makes a certain number of payments. That can protect the co-signer from a credit hit as a result of the primary borrower’s negative payment history. If you plan to use co-signer release, check your loan documents to see when it will be possible (in 36 months, for instance) and what additional requirements you might need to meet.
