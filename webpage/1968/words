Dr.
Danny
B.
Lange
is VP
of
AI
and
Machine
Learning
at
Unity
Technologies
. Formerly,
Danny
was Head
of
Machine
Learning
at
Uber where
he
led
an
effort
to
build
the
world’s
most
versatile
Machine
Learning
platform
to
support
Uber’s
rapid
growth.
What
initially
attracted
you
to
Artificial
Intelligence?
I
built
and
programmed
computers
from
a
very
young
age
and
I
was
almost
immediately
fascinated
by
the
idea
of
making
these
systems
autonomous.
What
captivates
me
about
autonomy
is
the
challenges
you
as
a
developer
have
to
overcome
in
creating
a
system
made
from
sequences
of
rigid
code
that
can
safely
respond
to
unpredictable
and
never-seen-before
circumstances.
The
field
of
Artificial
Intelligence
(AI)
has
over
the
years
provided
us
with
increasing
powerful
tools
from
object-oriented
programming,
rule-based
inference,
to
machine
learning
and
more
recently
deep
learning
.
It
is
the
increased
capabilities
of
these
technologies
that
fuel
the
rapid
progress
in
the
field
of
AI.
You
have
been
a
leader
in
the
space
for
many
years
such
as
being
General
Manager
for
Amazon
Machine
Learning
in
AWS,
and
Head
of
Machine
Learning
at
Uber.
What
are
some
of
the
lessons
that
you
have
learned
from
these
past
experiences?
Machine
learning
is
a
truly
transformative
technology,
but
to
realize
the
potential
to
its
fullest,
it
is
necessary
to
bring
it
to
every
corner
of
the
enterprise.
Repeatedly,
machine
learning
has
demonstrated
its
ability
to
create
unimaginable
optimizations
and
lift
business
operations
to
levels
that
cannot
be
achieved
by
ordinary
human
processes
alone.
However,
true
disruption
only
occurs
when
a
critical
mass
of
business
processes
are
operated
in
this
way.
What
organizations
such
as
Amazon
and
Uber
clearly
have
demonstrated
is
that
if
we
make
the
machine
learning
systems
broadly
approachable
and
available
to
every
team
we
experience
a
broad
adoption
that
invariably
leads
to
a
virtuous
cycle
of
continued
improvements
to
the
overall
business
as
a
network
effect
takes
place
You&#8217;ve
been
the
VP
of
AI
at
Unity
Technologies
since
2016.
What
was
it
about
this
company’s
vision
that
excited
you?
Unity
is
a
fantastic
place
for
the
AI
enthusiast.
We
have
a
remarkable
culture
of
solving
hard
problems
for
our
customers
&#8211;
with
AI
being
one
of
the
mightiest
challenges
that
i
can
think
of.
Our
leadership
is
committed
to
power
and
drive
the
future
of
AI.
We
have
the
technologies,
resources,
customers,
and
partners
to
do
just
that.
I
cannot
imagine
a
better
place
to
work
on
changing
the
world.
You’ve
spoken
before
about
the
importance
of
synthetic
data
,
could
you
share
with
us
what
this
is
precisely?
Synthetic
data
is
created
by
an
algorithm
as
opposed
to
data
captured
from
the
real
world.
A
real-time
3D
engine
with
a
realistic
physics
emulator,
is
the
ideal
tool
to
create
realistic
yet
synthetic
training
data
for
a
wide
variety
of
applications
ranging
from
object
recognition
in
computer
vision
systems
to
path
planning
for
navigational
robots.
What
makes
synthetic
data
so
important
when
it
comes
to
building
machine
learning
systems?
I
have
on
many
occasions
called
Unity
the
perfect
AI
Biodome.
And
it
is
true.
Working
with
AI
in
the
real
world
and
using
real-world
data
can
be
outright
scary.
Do
I
have
to
mention
self-driving
vehicles
on
the
streets
of
San
Francisco
or
face
recognition
systems
deployed
in
public
spaces?
There
are
worries
about
safety,
bias
is
always
lurking,
and
privacy
concerns
often
collide
with
common
use
cases.
And
then
there
is
the
scarcity
and
high
cost
associated
with
collecting
the
necessary
amounts
of
training
data.
With
Unity,
we
have
not
only
democratized
data
creation,
you
also
have
access
to
an
interactive
system
for
simulating
advanced
interactions
in
a
virtual
setting.
Within
Unity
you
can
develop
the
control
systems
for
an
autonomous
vehicle
without
the
risk
of
hitting
and
injuring
anyone.
Can
you
discuss
how
Unity
Simulation
can
assist
companies
with
the
generation
of
synthetic
data?
With
Unity
Simulation
we
have
taken
a
real-time
3D
engine
designed
for
human
consumption
whether
that
is
gaming,
film,
or
engineering
&#8211;
and
turned
into
an
cloudoptimized
instance
that
not
only
runs
at
unimaginable
high
frame
rates,
but
also
allows
for
scaling
to
thousands
of
instances
running
in
parallel.
In
this
way
Unity
Simulation
allows
developers
to
generate
experiences
for
their
AI
systems
orders
of
magnitude
faster
than
wallclock
time.
Until
recently,
this
scale
of
data
generation
was
only
available
to
a
few
privileged
corporations,
but
with
Unity
Simulation
we
have
truly
levelled
the
playing
field.
Recently,
Unity
has
teamed
up
with
The
Institute
for
Disease
Modeling
(IDM)
to
build
real-time
3D
in-store
simulations
that
model
COVID-19
spread
.
Can
you
discuss
how
Unity
Simulation
can
effectively
simulate
the
spread
of
COVID-19?
Computer
simulation
has
been
used
for
decades
by
researchers,
engineers,
problem
solvers,
and
policy
makers
in
many
fields,
including
the
study
of
infectious
disease.
Unity
Simulation
enables
a
special
kind
of
real-time
spatial
simulation
that
can
be
scaled
on
the
cloud
to
holistically
study
large,
complex,
and
uncertain
systems.
We
built
a
simplified
demonstration
project
to
simulate
coronavirus
spread
in
a
fictitious
grocery
store
and
explored
the
impact
that
store
policy
has
on
exposure
rates.
By
running
tenth
of
thousands
of
simulations,
we
were
able
to
identify
the
behaviors
and
policies
that
appeared
to
have
the
greatest
impact
on
the
spread
of
this
terrible
infectious
disease.
Recently,
you’ve
been
speaking
a
lot
about
Artificial
General
Intelligence
(AGI).
Can
you
explain
what
emergent
behavior
is
and
why
it’s
important
for
the
development
of
AGI?
In
just
100,000
years,
the
human
race
went
from
surviving
on
picking
berries
in
the
wild
to
putting
a
person
on
the
moon.
We
know
from
archaeogenetics
that
the
human
brain
has
not
changed
significantly
during
that
period
of
time.
You
can
say
there
were
no
significant
hardware
upgrades
to
the
processor.
So
what
was
it
then
that
was
so
transformative?
The
key
should
be
found
in
our
ability
to
accomplish
something
together.
We
use
the
term
emergent
behavior
of
a
system
that
does
not
depend
on
its
individual
parts,
but
rather
on
their
relationships
to
one
another.
Emergent
behavior
cannot
be
anticipated
by
investigating
the
individual
parts
of
a
system.
It
can
only
be
predicted
by
understanding
the
relationships
between
the
parts.
Emergent
systems
are
characterized
by
the
observation
that
the
whole
is
greater
than
the
sum
of
the
parts.
While
I
have
repeatedly
shown
entertaining
examples
of
emergent
behavior
in
relatively
simple
multi-agent
systems,
just
imagine
what
will
happen
when
you
have
a
plethora
of
AI
systems
collaborating
at
the
speed
of
light.
Do
you
believe
that
there
is
a
possibility
that
we
can
achieve
AGI
within
the
next
decade?
When
it
comes
to
AGI
we
have
to
remember
that
it
is
all
about
the
journey
and
not
the
destination.
Nobody
knows
exactly
when
AGI
will
happen
as
it
will
not
be
at
a
specific
moment
in
time,
but
rather
a
gradual
change
over
time.
It
is
in
the
nature
of
AGI
that
it
will
be
hard
for
us
humans
to
pinpoint
just
how
intelligent
a
system
at
any
given
moment.
Looking
at
the
progress
made
over
the
last
decade,
I
am
sure
that
this
decade
will
bring
us
plenty
of
interesting
progress
towards
AGI.
Is
there
anything
else
that
you
would
like
to
share
about
Unity
Technologies?
At
Unity,
we
continue
to
see
ourselves
powering
the
future
of
AI
and
playing
a
significant
role
in
the
advancement
of
AI
technologies.
As
our
relationship
with
DeepMind
is
a
clear
demonstration
of
our
technology
is
the
perfect
environment
for
researchers
and
developers
to
safely
push
the
boundaries
of
AI.
We
are
gearing
up
to
support
our
customers
and
partners
in
creating
virtual
environments
that
operate
at
previously
unseen
scale
to
solve
the
challenges
of
tomorrow
whether
that
is
climate
change,
logistics,
or
health
challenges.
Thank
you
for
the
amazing
interview,
I
enjoyed
learning
about
Unity
and
your
views
on
AGI.
