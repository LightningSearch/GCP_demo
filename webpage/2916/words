Note:
Forbes
may
earn
a
commission
on
sales
made
from
partner
links
on
this
page,
but
that
doesn't
affect
our
editors'
opinions
or
evaluations.
Your
Instagram
feed
might
make
it
seem
like
travel
hacking
is
just
for
the
most
frequent
of
flyers.
Guess
again.
It&#8217;s
easier
than
you
think
to
leverage
your
credit
card
rewards
to
snag
award
flights
and
upgrades
using
miles
and
points.
That
said,
be
sure
to
have
your
credit
house
in
order
before
you
start
earning
rewards
because
the
interest
rates
and
fees
will
outweigh
what
you
earn
on
a
monthly
balance.
The
right
card
for
you
is
based
on
your
goals
and
circumstances.
A
couple
spending
towards
a
honeymoon
in
Paris,
France
will
have
different
needs
than
a
family
trying
to
visit
family
in
Paris,
Texas.  Always
do
the
math
for
your
personal
spending
and
consider
how
you
would
use
the
benefits
before
applying
for
a
new
card.
Our
guide
to
the
Best
Travel
Rewards
Credit
Cards
of
2021
is
a
great
place
to
start,
whether
your
plans
take
you
to
the
skies
or
just
down
the
road.

Why
We
Picked
It
While

doesn't
have
an
extensive

the

is
outstanding.
If
you
are
a
regular
at
Hyatt,
a
combination
of
high
point
redemption
values,
sweet
perks
and
one
free
night
stay
per
year
will
easily
cover
the
annual

and

The
Chase
Sapphire
Reserve
makes
the
top
of
our
list
of
best
travel
rewards
cards
for
many
reasons.
While
it
does
charge
a
high
annual
fee,
it
earns
valuable
rewards
at
a
good
rate,
and
offers
a
plethora
of
travel
benefits
including
best-in-market
travel
insurance
benefits.
If

and
1

purchases.
Purchases
that
count
toward
the
$300
credit
will
not
earn

and

full
of
benefits.

redeemed
for

at
a
1:1
ratio
where
they
can
potentially
be
redeemed
for
even
more
value.
Cardholders
can
make
up
for
a
chunk
of
the
annual
fee
with
the
$300

travel
credit.
This
credit
is
applied
automatically
to
your
first

travel
purchases,
and
Chase
has
a
broad

of
what

as
travel.

you
can
rest
assured
when
you
travel
because
the

available
on
any
credit

Express’
partners,
including
Delta,
Virgin
Atlantic
and
Avios.
While
this
card
doesn’t
pack
travel
specific
benefits,
it
does
have
a
number
of
other
notable
benefits
including
up
to
$120
in
dining
credits
(valid
at
GrubHub,
Seamless,
The
Cheesecake
Factory,
Ruth’s
Chris
Steakhouse,
Boxed
and
participating
Shake
Shack
locations—issued
in
$10
monthly
statement
credits).
If
you’re
looking
for
a
card
with
solid
travel
benefits
but
a
lower
annual
fee
than
the
most
premium
cards,
the
American
Express
Gold
Card
may
be
a
good
fit.

Card

If
you’re
looking
for
a
simple
travel
rewards
card,
the
Capital
One
Venture
Rewards
Credit
Card
is
a
good
place
to
start.
It
offers
flat-rate
earnings
on
all
purchases
and
the
ability
to
redeem
your
points
for
eligible
travel
purchases.
Rewards:
Earn
an
unlimited
2
miles
per
dollar
spent
on
all
purchases.
Welcome
Offer:
Enjoy
a
one-time
bonus
of
60,000
miles
once
you
spend
$3,000
on
purchases
within
3
months
from
account
opening,
equal
to
$600
in
travel
Annual
Fee:
$95
Other
Benefits
and
Drawbacks:
In
addition
to
being
able
to
redeem
your
rewards
for
a
statement
credit
against
travel
purchases,
Capital
One
also
gives
you
the
ability
to
transfer
your
miles
to
participating
airline
and
hotel
partners.
However,
mileage
transfers
are
not
at
a
1:1
ratio
like
with
other
types
of
flexible
rewards.
Additionally,
the
transfer
programs
available
are
not
the
most
simple
to
use.
The
Venture
Card
also
will
give
you
up
to
a
$100
credit
to
cover
your
Global
Entry
or
TSA
PreCheck
application
fee
and
doesn’t
charge
foreign
transaction
fees.
If
you’re
looking
at
the
Venture
card,
consider
it
a
simple
flexible
card,
with
a
handful
of
additional
benefits.
If
you
really
want
to
maximize
the
value
of
your
points
and
miles,
you’ll
be
better
served
by
a
different
flexible
rewards
card.

While
this

has
a
steep

If
you’re
looking
for
the
card
that
packs
in
the
most
Delta
benefits,
the
Delta
SkyMiles
Reserve
card
may
be
for
you.
Its
most
notable
benefit
is
access
to
Delta
SkyClub
lounges
when
you
travel
on
a
Delta
flight.
Rewards:
Earn

(

)
Other
Benefits
and
Drawbacks:
The
Delta
SkyMiles
Reserve
card
is
not
a
card
to
get
for
daily
spending
because
it
does
not
offer
great
earnings
rates.
If
you’re
interested
in
earning
Delta
SkyMiles,
a
better
option
is
to
get
a
card
that
earns
American
Express
Membership
Rewards
points.
Membership
Rewards
transfer
at
a
1:1
ratio
to
Delta.
However,
if
you’re
looking
for
benefits
when
you
fly
Delta,
this
card
is
tough
to
beat.
The
most
notable
benefit
is
access
to
Delta
SkyClubs
when
you
fly
Delta,
however,
you’ll
only
receive
two
annual
one-time
passes
to
bring
guests
in
with
you.
You’ll
also
have
access
to
American
Express’
exclusive
Centurion
Lounges
when
you
book
your
Delta
flight
with
your
Delta
Reserve
card.
This
card
also
offers
a
couple
of
features
that
can
help
you
on
your
way
to
earning
Delta
Medallion
status.
It
offers
the
ability
to
earn
15,000
Medallion
Qualification
Miles
(MQMs)
when
you
spend
$30,000
on
your
card,
up
to
four
times
per
calendar
year.
You
can
also
earn
a
waiver
for
the
Medallion
Qualification
Spending
requirement
by
spending
$25,000
on
your
card
within
the
calendar
year.
If
you
have
status
with
Delta
already,
you’ll
be
put
ahead
of
other
members
with
the
same
status
level
as
you
on
the
upgrade
priority
list,
and
if
you
don’t
have
status
you’ll
still
be
eligible
for
upgrades
after
all
other
Medallion
members.
Cardholders
will
also
receive
their
first
checked
bag
on
Delta
flights
for
free,
priority
boarding
and
20%
back
on
in-flight
purchases
when
using
their
Reserve
card.
Other
travel-related
benefits
offered
by
this
card
include
up
to
a
$100
credit
to
cover
your
Global
Entry
or
TSA
PreCheck
application
fee,
trip
delay
and
cancellation
coverage
and
secondary
car
rental
insurance.
You
also
may
benefit
from
purchase
protection,
return
protection
and
extended
warranty.
If
you
want
access
to
some
Delta
benefits,
but
you
don’t
want
to
pay
a
high

United
Club℠
Infinite
Card
[
jump
to
details
]
As
a
general
rule,
if
you’re
looking
for
an
airline-specific
card,
you’ll
want
to
get
a
card
with
the
airline
you
fly
the
most.
If
you
won’t
benefit
from
free
checked
bags
and
priority
boarding—either
because
you
already
have
status,
because
you
don’t
check
bags
or
because
you
don’t
fly
a
specific
airline
enough—you’ll
benefit
more
from
a
flexible
travel
card
like
the
Chase
Sapphire
Reserve
or
Chase
Sapphire
Preferred®
Card.
In
terms
of
the
airline
card
that
offers
the
best
earnings
potential,
valuable
points
and
additional
useful
benefits,
the
United
Club
Card
comes
out
ahead.
Rewards:
Earn
4
United
miles
per
dollar
spent
on
purchases
from
United,
2
miles
per
dollar
spent
on
all
other
travel
purchases
and
at
restaurants
(including
takeout
and
delivery),
and
1
mile
per

spent
on
all

purchases.
Welcome
Offer:
Earn
75,000

miles
after
you
spend
$3,000
on
purchases
in
the
first
3
months
from
account
opening
Annual
Fee:
$525
Other
Benefits
and
Drawbacks:
The
most
prominent
benefit
of
the
United
Club
Card
is
access
to
United
Club
airport
lounges
and
other
Star
Alliance
Gold
lounges.
If
you
want
access
to
United
Clubs,
this
card
is
the
most
affordable
way
to
get
that
access
(yes,
the
annual
fee
is
cheaper
than
paying
for
access
directly).
If
this
sounds
like
you,
you’ll
come
out
ahead
right
away.
If
you’re
not
at
all
interested
in
lounge
access,
this
card
isn’t
likely
to
be
the
best
choice.
If
you
are
a
regular
United
flyer,
you’ll
also
benefit
from
two
free
checked
bags
for
yourself
and
another
person
traveling
on
the
same
reservation,
Premier
Access,
25%
back
on
in-flight
purchases,
expanded
access
to
award
flights
and
Premier
Upgrades
on
award
tickets
if
you
have
status.
The
United
Club
Infinite
Card
offers
benefits
not
related
to
flying
United,
too.
You’ll
get
up
to
$100
back
to
cover
the
application
fee
for
Global
Entry
or
TSA
PreCheck
and
Hertz
President’s
Circle
status.
You’ll
also
receive
the
following
travel
insurance
coverage:
trip
cancellation/interruption,
trip
delay,
lost/damaged
baggage,
delayed
baggage
and
primary
auto
rental
collision
damage.
This
card
offers
other
protections
including
purchase
protection,
return
protection
and
extended
warranty
coverage.
If
you
want
United
benefits
like
free
checked
bags,
priority
boarding
and
expanded
access
to
award
availability,
but
you
don’t
want
to
pay
the
United
Club
Infinite
Card’s
annual
fee,
consider

Card.

we
have
some
bad
news
for
you.
It’s
hard
to
earn
them
without
actually
getting
up
in
the
air.
None
of
the
Citi

cards
offer
great
earnings
and
you
can’t
transfer
Ultimate

ThankYou

Nevertheless,
if
it’s
American

benefits
you’re
after,
the
Citi/AAdvantage
Executive
card
will
give
you
the
best
American
Airlines
benefits
you
can
get
through
a
credit
card.
More
importantly,
the
Citi/AAdvantage
Executive
card
grants
an
American
Airlines
AAdmirals
Club
membership
to
the
primary
cardholder.
Authorized
users
on
the
card
will
also
have
access
to
American

AAdmirals

lounges,
but
not
a
full
membership.
You’ll
get
your
first

free
on
American

flights,
priority
check-in
and

and
25%

on

Hilton
Honors
Aspire
Card
from
American
Express
*
[
jump
to
details
]
Similar
to
the
best
airline
card,
if
you’re
looking
for
an
hotel-specific
card,
you’ll
want
to
get
a
card
with
the
hotel
chain
you
stay
with
the
most.
As
a
general
rule,
hotel
cards
aren’t
packed
full
of
benefits
and
aren’t
the
best
for
daily
spending.
The
Hilton
Aspire
card
is
an
exception,
and
if
you
stay
with
Hilton
hotels
regularly
(especially
if
it’s
not
enough
to
earn
at
least
Gold
status),
this
card
may
make
sense
to
add
to
your
wallet.
Rewards:
Earn
14
Hilton
Honors
points
per
dollar
spent
at
Hilton
properties,
7

Points
after
you
spend

in
purchases
on
the
Card
within
your
first
3
months
of
Card
Membership
Annual
Fee:
$450
Other
Benefits
and
Drawbacks:
While
the
Hilton
Aspire
card
earns
more
points
than
some
other
cards
on
this
list,
keep
in
mind
that
hotel
points
are
generally
not
as
valuable
as
airline
miles
or
flexible
rewards
points.
That
said,
the
Hilton
Aspire
Card
is
still
a
card
that
packs
in
the
benefits.
In
addition
to
earning
points
at
a
relatively
quick
rate,
the
Hilton
Aspire
card
also
offers
complimentary
top-tier
Hilton
Honors
Diamond
status.
Hilton
Diamond
status
will
afford
you
benefits
like
complimentary
breakfast,
100%
Bonus
Points
on
Hilton
stays,
lounge
access
and
more
when
you
stay
at
Hilton
Hotels.
The
Aspire
is
the
only
hotel
card
that
offers
top-tier
status
just
for
holding
the
card.
Cardholders
will
receive
a
free
night
award
that
is
valid
for
any
Hilton
property
(availability
required),
but
only
on
the
weekend.
You
can
earn
an
additional
free
night
award
after
spending
$60,000
on
your
card
within
a
year.
Cardholders
also
receive
up
to
$250
in
statement
credits
for
purchases
made
at

How
to
Choose
a
Travel
Rewards
Card
Choosing
a
travel
rewards
card
is
no
easy
task.
There
are
more
cards
on
the
market
than
we
can
count,
miles
and
points
are
not
valued
the
same
across
programs
and
programs
change
how
miles
can
be
redeemed
regularly.
While
this
list
is
a
great
place
to
start,
you’ll
also
want
to
ask
yourself
the
following
questions.
How
hard
do
I
want
to
work?
If
you
want
the
most
bang
for
your
buck
(or
time),
you
should
consider
cards
with
simple-to-use
structures.
The
Chase
Sapphire
Cards
as
well
as
the
Capital
One
Venture
all
allow
you
to
redeem
your
points
for
any
type
of
travel
purchase
for
good
value.
It’s
possible
to
get
more
value
out
of
your
rewards
using
transfer
partners,
but
you’ll
have
to
be
prepared
to
put
in
the
time
to
learn
the
programs
in
order
to
make
sure
you’re
getting
a
good
deal.
How
often
do
you
travel?
If
you
only
travel
once
or
twice
per
year,
you
probably
should
choose
a
card
with
a
low
annual
fee.
If
you
travel
more
regularly,
you’re
likely
to
benefit
more
from
a
premium
travel
rewards
card.
Do
you
always
fly
the
same
airline?
If
you
always
fly
the
same
airline,
it
may
make
sense
to
get
that
airline’s
co-branded
credit
card,
especially
if
you
want
access
to
the
airport
lounges
and
free
checked
bags.
If
you
don’t
care
about
lounge
access
or
checked
bags,
you
might
be
better
off
choosing
a
card
that
earns
points
that
transfer
to
your
primary
airline.
Chase
Ultimate
Rewards
transfer
to
United
and
American
Express
Membership
Rewards
transfer
to
Delta.
If
you
don’t
always
fly
the
same
airline,
it
likely
makes
sense
to
get
a
more
flexible
travel
rewards
card.
What
benefits
matter
to
you
and
how
often
will
you
use
them?
While
travel
rewards
cards
can
offer
a
lot
of
benefits,
these
are
only
benefits
if
you
use
them.
If
you
don’t,
there’s
no
reason
to
have
a
credit
card
offering
them—especially
if
it
has
a
sizable
annual
fee
like
many
in
this
list.
Also
be
realistic
about
how
often
you’ll
use
the
benefits
and
how
much
the
card
is
really
worth
to
you.

Frequently
Asked
Questions
How
many
miles
do
you
need
for
a
free
flight?
The
number
of
miles
you
need
for
a
free
flight
depends
on
different
factors
including
which
airline
miles
you
are
using,
where
you
are
flying
to
and
from,
when
you
are
traveling
and
other
factors.
Domestic
flights
in
the
U.S.
will
generally
require
fewer
miles
than
an
international
flight.
Typically,
count
on
spending
between
4,000
and
20,000
miles
for
a
domestic
one-way
flight
in
economy.
Long-haul
international
flights
can
cost
quite
a
bit
more.
Plan
on
spending
between
20,000
to
30,000
miles
each
way
to
fly
to
Europe
and
even
more
for
flights
to
Asia,
Africa,
and
Oceania.
Don’t
forget
to
consider
the
cost
of
checked
bags
and
fuel
surcharges
before
booking
your
ticket.
What’s
better:
cash
back
or
travel
rewards?
Whether
you
should
earn
cash
back
or
travel
rewards
depends
on
your
personal
preferences
including
when
and
where
you
want
to
travel,
how
much
work
you
want
to
put
into
a
redemption
and
how
often
you
want
to
be
able
to
use
your
rewards.
As
a
general
rule,
using
cash
back
rewards
for
travel-related
purchases
would
be
unwise.
Travel
rewards
typically
offer
a
higher
rewards
rate
for
travel-related
purchases
then
a
typical
cash
back
rewards
card.
The
inverse
is
also
true.
If
you
are
using
a
travel
rewards
credit
card
and
redeeming
your
points
for
statement
credit,
you
are
typically
losing
out
on
a
higher
rewards
rate
than
if
you
had
used
a
cash
back
card
instead.
Therefore,
if
you’re
a
frequent
traveler,
choose
a
travel
rewards
card.
If
traveling
is
not
your
thing,
a
cash
back
rewards
card
would
be
a
wiser
choice.
Keep
in
mind,
you
can
have
both
types
of
cards
in
your
wallet.
Are
travel
rewards
credit
cards
with
an
annual
fee
worth
the
cost?
Credit
cards
with
annual
fees
typically
are
packed
full
of
benefits
that
can
make
paying
the
annual
fee
worthwhile
as
long
as
you
use
the
benefits
offered.
Before
applying
for
a
card
with
an
annual
fee,
and
regularly
while
you
have
the
card,
look
at
the
benefits
that
you
actually
use
and
weigh
those
benefits
against
what
you
are
paying
to
keep
the
card
open.
How
do
travel
rewards
credit
cards
work?
A
travel
rewards
credit
card
accrues
miles
or
points
for
each
purchase
made
with
the
card.
Often,
these
cards
have
an
enticing
sign-up
bonus
that
typically
requires
spending
a
certain
amount
of
money
within
a
specific
time
period
after
opening
the
card.
After
earning
miles
or
points,
there
are
typically
a
few
redemption
options
including
redeeming
for
airline
tickets,
gift
cards
or
statement
credits.
As
a
general
rule,
redeeming
miles
and
points
for
travel
will
result
in
the
most
value.
Why
types
of
travel
cards
are
there?
There
are
two
types
of
travel
credit
cards.
Branded
credit
cards
are
specific
to
one
airline
or
hotel
chain.
They
typically
offer
less
flexible
rewards
but
sometimes
offer
greater
value,
especially
when
considering
additional
perks
of
the
card
like
free
checked
bags
or
complimentary
elite
status.
Non-branded
travel
cards
typically
offer
more
flexible
rewards
that
can
either
be
transferred
to
a
number
of
different
airlines
and
hotels
or
redeemed
at
a
fixed
cash-value
for
travel,
gift
cards,
and/or
statement
credits.
It
makes
sense
to
consider
the
rewards
rate,
additional
perks,
you
travel
patterns
and
your
goals
before
determining
if
a
branded
or
non-branded
credit
card
is
the
best
choice
for
you.
It
could
also
make
sense
to
have
one
(or
multiple)
of
each.
What
credit
score
do
you
need
to
get
a
travel
rewards
credit
card?
A
travel
rewards
credit
card
will
typically
require
good
to
excellent
credit
in
order
to
qualify.
Plan
to
have
a
credit
score
of
at
least
700
to
get
approved
by
the
top
credit
cards
on
the
market.
Some
of
the
top
travel
cards
on
the
market
might
even
require
applicants
to
have
a
credit
score
of
720
or
higher.
