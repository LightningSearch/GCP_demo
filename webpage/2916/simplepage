We rated cards based on their fees, rewards potential, value of rewards earned, ongoing benefits and more. The top airline, hotel and flexible rewards cards were chosen for this list. Best Travel Rewards Cards Chase Sapphire Reserve&reg; [ jump to details ] The Chase Sapphire Reserve makes the top of our list of best travel rewards cards for many reasons. While it does charge a high annual fee, it earns valuable rewards at a good rate, and offers a plethora of travel benefits including best-in-market travel insurance benefits. If you travel at least a couple times per year, this card deserves serious consideration. Rewards: Earn 3 Ultimate Rewards points per dollar spent on travel and at restaurants and 1 Ultimate Reward point per dollar spent on all other purchases. Purchases that count toward the $300 credit will not earn rewards. Welcome Offer: Earn 60,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening. Annual Fee: $550 Other Benefits and Drawbacks: The Chase Sapphire Reserve is packed full of benefits. First off, your Ultimate Rewards points can be redeemed for cash back at a rate of 1 cent per point, redeemed for travel through the Chase travel portal or through the Pay Yourself Back feature for 1.5 cents each or transferred to Chase’s travel partners, including Hyatt and United, at a 1:1 ratio where they can potentially be redeemed for even more value. Cardholders can make up for a chunk of the annual fee with the $300 annual travel credit. This credit is applied automatically to your first $300 in travel purchases, and Chase has a broad definition of what counts as travel. Other benefits that are very likely to come in handy include a Priority Pass Select airport lounge membership with access to over 1,200 airport lounges worldwide once you enroll, and up to a $100 credit to cover your Global Entry or TSA PreCheck application fee. Finally, you can rest assured when you travel because the Sapphire Reserve offers the best travel protections available on any credit card. You’ll get trip cancellation and interruption coverage, trip delay coverage, lost and damaged baggage coverage, delayed baggage coverage and primary car rental insurance coverage. This card also offers purchase protection, return protection and extended warranty benefits. Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card [ jump to details ] People who have significant expenses on travel or at restaurants and those who want to make their airport experience more comfortable with lounge access will do better with the Chase Sapphire Reserve, but if you want to start earning Ultimate Rewards points and benefit from travel insurance without paying a high annual fee, this card is a good place to start. Rewards: Earn 2 Ultimate Rewards points per dollar spent on travel and at restaurants plus 1 Ultimate Reward per dollar spent on all other purchases. Welcome Offer: Earn 80,000 bonus points after you spend $4,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening. That's $1,000 when you redeem through Chase Ultimate Rewards®. Plus earn a $50 statement credit towards grocery store purchases within your first year of account opening. Annual Fee: $95 Other Benefits and Drawbacks: Chase Ultimate Rewards points can be redeemed for cash back for 1 cent each, through Chase’s travel portal or using the Pay Yourself Back option for 1.25 cents each or transferred to Chase’s airline and hotel transfer partners, like United and Hyatt, at a 1:1 ratio. The main benefit that you’ll get access to the points earning is Chase’s comprehensive travel protections. The Sapphire Preferred offers trip cancellation/interruption coverage, trip delay coverage, lost and damaged baggage coverage, bag delay coverage, and primary car rental insurance. It also offers purchase protection and extended warranty coverage. American Express&reg; Gold Card [ jump to details ] If you travel occasionally but also want a card that offers accelerated points earning in more categories, the American Express Gold Card is a viable option. In addition to bonus earnings on flights, you can earn more points at restaurants and at U.S. supermarkets. Rewards: Earn 4 Membership Rewards points per dollar on the first $25,000 spent annually at U.S. supermarkets and at restaurants, 3 Membership Rewards per dollar on flights booked directly with airlines or through American Express Travel and 1 Membership Reward per dollar on all other purchases. Welcome Offer: Earn 60,000 Membership Rewards® points after you spend $4,000 on eligible purchases with your new Card within the first 6 months Annual Fee: $250( rates &amp; fees ) Other Benefits and Drawbacks: Membership Rewards points can be redeemed for travel directly through American Express or they can be transferred at a 1:1 ratio to American Express’ partners, including Delta, Virgin Atlantic and Avios. While this card doesn’t pack travel specific benefits, it does have a number of other notable benefits including up to $120 in dining credits (valid at GrubHub, Seamless, The Cheesecake Factory, Ruth’s Chris Steakhouse, Boxed and participating Shake Shack locations—issued in $10 monthly statement credits). If you’re looking for a card with solid travel benefits but a lower annual fee than the most premium cards, the American Express Gold Card may be a good fit. Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card [ jump to details ] If you’re looking for a simple travel rewards card, the Capital One Venture Rewards Credit Card is a good place to start. It offers flat-rate earnings on all purchases and the ability to redeem your points for eligible travel purchases. Rewards: Earn an unlimited 2 miles per dollar spent on all purchases. Welcome Offer: Enjoy a one-time bonus of 60,000 miles once you spend $3,000 on purchases within 3 months from account opening, equal to $600 in travel Annual Fee: $95 Other Benefits and Drawbacks: In addition to being able to redeem your rewards for a statement credit against travel purchases, Capital One also gives you the ability to transfer your miles to participating airline and hotel partners. However, mileage transfers are not at a 1:1 ratio like with other types of flexible rewards. Additionally, the transfer programs available are not the most simple to use. The Venture Card also will give you up to a $100 credit to cover your Global Entry or TSA PreCheck application fee and doesn’t charge foreign transaction fees. If you’re looking at the Venture card, consider it a simple flexible card, with a handful of additional benefits. If you really want to maximize the value of your points and miles, you’ll be better served by a different flexible rewards card. The Platinum Card® from American Express [ jump to details ] If you’re looking for lounge access but you’re not set on a specific airline’s lounges, the Platinum Card from American Express is for you. You’ll get access to three different lounge programs with this card, in addition to a bunch of other travel benefits. Rewards: Earn 5 Membership Rewards points per dollar spent on flights booked directly with the airline on up to $500,000 in purchases per year and on hotels booked through American Express Travel. Earn 1 Membership Reward point per dollar spent on all other purchases. Welcome Offer: Earn 75,000 Membership Rewards® Points after you spend $5,000 on purchases on your new Card in your first 6 months of Card Membership. Plus, earn 10x points on eligible purchases on your new Card at U.S. Gas Stations and U.S. Supermarkets, on up to $15,000 in combined purchases, during your first 6 months of Card Membership. That’s an additional 9 points on top of the 1 point you earn for these purchases. Annual Fee: $550 ( rates &amp; fees ) Other Benefits and Drawbacks: If you’re looking for lounge access, this is the card for you. The Platinum Card from American Express gives you a Priority Pass Select lounge membership with access to over 1,200 airport lounges worldwide in addition to access to American Express’ exclusive Centurion Lounges and Delta Sky Clubs when you fly Delta same-day. You can also get up to $200 back per year in Uber Cash credits for rides or Uber Eats in the U.S. —$15 each month and a $20 bonus in December when you link your Platinum card to your Uber account —and up to $100 back on purchases at Saks Fifth Avenue. Other benefits include a $200 airline incidental fee credit on an eligible airline you select each year—valid for seat selection fees, checked bag fees and more—and a fee credit for your Global Entry or TSA PreCheck application fee. Cardholders also have access to the Fine Hotels &amp; Resorts Program and the International Airline Program for savings and additional perks at hotels and on flights. If you book hotels directly with either Hilton or Marriott, you’ll benefit from Gold status with each program and complimentary membership in premium car rental programs. This card also includes car rental loss and damage insurance. Last but not least, Membership Rewards points are incredibly versatile. They can be transferred at a 1:1 ratio to American Express’ airline partners or they can be used to redeem for flights directly through American Express. While this card has a steep annual fee, the benefits can easily offset the annual fee and then some, as long as you use them. Ink Business Preferred&reg; Credit Card [ jump to details ] If you have a business and you’re looking for a solid travel rewards card, you probably don’t need to look much further than the Chase Ink Business Preferred. It offers the ability to earn valuable Ultimate Rewards points across a wide range of categories and doesn’t charge a high annual fee. Rewards: Earn 3 Ultimate Rewards per dollar on the first $150,000 spent annually on travel, shipping purchases, cable, internet, phone services and advertising purchases made directly with social media sites and search engines. Earn 1 Ultimate Reward point per dollar spent on all other purchases. Welcome Offer: Earn 100k bonus points after you spend $15,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening. That's $1,000 cash back or $1,250 toward travel when redeemed through Chase Ultimate Rewards® Annual Fee: $95 Other Benefits and Drawbacks: After you’ve earned a stash of valuable Chase Ultimate Reward points, you’ll be able to redeem them at a rate of 1 cent each for cash back or 1.25 cents each when used toward travel through the Chase portal. You can also transfer your points at a 1:1 ratio to airline and hotel partners including United and Hyatt where you may be able to get even more value for your points. The Ink Business Preferred also offers a number of additional travel and purchase protections including trip cancellation/interruption coverage, primary rental car insurance coverage when your rental is for business purposes or secondary coverage when your rental is not for business purposes, cell phone protection, extended warranty and purchase protection. Delta SkyMiles&reg; Reserve American Express Card [ jump to details ] If you’re looking for the card that packs in the most Delta benefits, the Delta SkyMiles Reserve card may be for you. Its most notable benefit is access to Delta SkyClub lounges when you travel on a Delta flight. Rewards: Earn 3 Delta SkyMiles per dollar spent on Delta purchases and 1 SkyMile per dollar spent on all other purchases. Welcome Offer: Limited Time Offer: Earn 80,000 bonus miles and 20,000 Medallion® Qualification Miles (MQMs) after you spend $5,000 in purchases on your new Card in your first 3 months. Offer expires 4/28/2021. Annual Fee: $550 ( rates &amp; fees ) Other Benefits and Drawbacks: The Delta SkyMiles Reserve card is not a card to get for daily spending because it does not offer great earnings rates. If you’re interested in earning Delta SkyMiles, a better option is to get a card that earns American Express Membership Rewards points. Membership Rewards transfer at a 1:1 ratio to Delta. However, if you’re looking for benefits when you fly Delta, this card is tough to beat. The most notable benefit is access to Delta SkyClubs when you fly Delta, however, you’ll only receive two annual one-time passes to bring guests in with you. You’ll also have access to American Express’ exclusive Centurion Lounges when you book your Delta flight with your Delta Reserve card. This card also offers a couple of features that can help you on your way to earning Delta Medallion status. It offers the ability to earn 15,000 Medallion Qualification Miles (MQMs) when you spend $30,000 on your card, up to four times per calendar year. You can also earn a waiver for the Medallion Qualification Spending requirement by spending $25,000 on your card within the calendar year. If you have status with Delta already, you’ll be put ahead of other members with the same status level as you on the upgrade priority list, and if you don’t have status you’ll still be eligible for upgrades after all other Medallion members. Cardholders will also receive their first checked bag on Delta flights for free, priority boarding and 20% back on in-flight purchases when using their Reserve card. Other travel-related benefits offered by this card include up to a $100 credit to cover your Global Entry or TSA PreCheck application fee, trip delay and cancellation coverage and secondary car rental insurance. You also may benefit from purchase protection, return protection and extended warranty. If you want access to some Delta benefits, but you don’t want to pay a high annual fee, consider the Delta SkyMiles® Platinum American Express Card or the Delta SkyMiles® Gold American Express Card. United Club℠ Infinite Card [ jump to details ] As a general rule, if you’re looking for an airline-specific card, you’ll want to get a card with the airline you fly the most. If you won’t benefit from free checked bags and priority boarding—either because you already have status, because you don’t check bags or because you don’t fly a specific airline enough—you’ll benefit more from a flexible travel card like the Chase Sapphire Reserve or Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card. In terms of the airline card that offers the best earnings potential, valuable points and additional useful benefits, the United Club Card comes out ahead. Rewards: Earn 4 United miles per dollar spent on purchases from United, 2 miles per dollar spent on all other travel purchases and at restaurants (including takeout and delivery), and 1 mile per dollar spent on all other purchases. Welcome Offer: Earn 75,000 bonus miles after you spend $3,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening Annual Fee: $525 Other Benefits and Drawbacks: The most prominent benefit of the United Club Card is access to United Club airport lounges and other Star Alliance Gold lounges. If you want access to United Clubs, this card is the most affordable way to get that access (yes, the annual fee is cheaper than paying for access directly). If this sounds like you, you’ll come out ahead right away. If you’re not at all interested in lounge access, this card isn’t likely to be the best choice. If you are a regular United flyer, you’ll also benefit from two free checked bags for yourself and another person traveling on the same reservation, Premier Access, 25% back on in-flight purchases, expanded access to award flights and Premier Upgrades on award tickets if you have status. The United Club Infinite Card offers benefits not related to flying United, too. You’ll get up to $100 back to cover the application fee for Global Entry or TSA PreCheck and Hertz President’s Circle status. You’ll also receive the following travel insurance coverage: trip cancellation/interruption, trip delay, lost/damaged baggage, delayed baggage and primary auto rental collision damage. This card offers other protections including purchase protection, return protection and extended warranty coverage. If you want United benefits like free checked bags, priority boarding and expanded access to award availability, but you don’t want to pay the United Club Infinite Card’s annual fee, consider the United℠ Explorer Card. Citi® / AAdvantage® Executive World Elite Mastercard® * [ jump to details ] If you’re interested in benefits with American Airlines when you fly, including access to AAdmirals Club lounges, the Citi/AAdvantage Executive World Elite Mastercard may be the best option for you. Rewards: Earn 2 AAdvantage miles per dollar spent on purchases with American Airlines and 1 AAdvantage mile per dollar spent on all other purchases. Welcome Offer: Earn 50,000 American Airlines AAdvantage® bonus miles after making $5,000 in purchases within the first 3 months of account opening. Plus, Admiral's Club® membership Annual Fee: $450 Other Benefits and Drawbacks: If you want to earn American Airlines AAdvantage miles, we have some bad news for you. It’s hard to earn them without actually getting up in the air. None of the Citi co-branded cards offer great earnings and you can’t transfer Ultimate Rewards, Membership Rewards or ThankYou Points to American Airlines. Nevertheless, if it’s American Airlines benefits you’re after, the Citi/AAdvantage Executive card will give you the best American Airlines benefits you can get through a credit card. More importantly, the Citi/AAdvantage Executive card grants an American Airlines AAdmirals Club membership to the primary cardholder. Authorized users on the card will also have access to American Airlines AAdmirals Club lounges, but not a full membership. You’ll get your first checked bag free on American Airlines flights, priority check-in and boarding and 25% savings on in-flight purchases. Cardholders will also have up to a $100 credit for their Global Entry or TSA PreCheck application fee. Hilton Honors Aspire Card from American Express * [ jump to details ] Similar to the best airline card, if you’re looking for an hotel-specific card, you’ll want to get a card with the hotel chain you stay with the most. As a general rule, hotel cards aren’t packed full of benefits and aren’t the best for daily spending. The Hilton Aspire card is an exception, and if you stay with Hilton hotels regularly (especially if it’s not enough to earn at least Gold status), this card may make sense to add to your wallet. Rewards: Earn 14 Hilton Honors points per dollar spent at Hilton properties, 7 Hilton Honors points per dollar spent at U.S. restaurants, airfare booked directly with airlines or American Express Travel and eligible car rentals, plus 3 Hilton Honors points per dollar spent on all other purchases. Welcome Offer: Earn 150,000 Hilton Honors Bonus Points after you spend $4,000 in purchases on the Card within your first 3 months of Card Membership Annual Fee: $450 Other Benefits and Drawbacks: While the Hilton Aspire card earns more points than some other cards on this list, keep in mind that hotel points are generally not as valuable as airline miles or flexible rewards points. That said, the Hilton Aspire Card is still a card that packs in the benefits. In addition to earning points at a relatively quick rate, the Hilton Aspire card also offers complimentary top-tier Hilton Honors Diamond status. Hilton Diamond status will afford you benefits like complimentary breakfast, 100% Bonus Points on Hilton stays, lounge access and more when you stay at Hilton Hotels. The Aspire is the only hotel card that offers top-tier status just for holding the card. Cardholders will receive a free night award that is valid for any Hilton property (availability required), but only on the weekend. You can earn an additional free night award after spending $60,000 on your card within a year. Cardholders also receive up to $250 in statement credits for purchases made at participating Hilton Resorts. The Hilton Aspire card has quite a few non-Hilton-related travel benefits too. Cardholders will receive a complimentary Priority Pass Select airport lounge membership, a $250 airline fee credit for incidental purchases at an eligible airline you select each year and car rental loss and damage insurance. This card also offers return protection. The World of Hyatt Credit Card * [ jump to details ] If you’re looking for a Hotel credit card, the best card for you is going to depend on which hotel chain you prefer to stay with. While the World of Hyatt credit card isn’t necessarily the best way to earn Hyatt points, it is a good option for people who frequent Hyatt hotels. Rewards: Earn 4 Hyatt points per dollar spent at Hyatt hotels; 2 points per dollar spent with local transit and commuting; 2 points per dollar spent at restaurants, cafes and coffee shops; 2 points per dollar spent on flights purchased directly with the airline; 2 points per dollar spent on staying healthy with fitness clubs and gym memberships; and 1 point per dollar spent on all other purchases. Welcome Offer: Earn 30,000 Bonus Points after you spend $3,000 on purchases in your first 3 months from account opening. Plus, up to 30,000 More Bonus Points by earning 2 Bonus Points total per $1 spent in the first 6 months from account opening on purchases that normally earn 1 Bonus Point, on up to $15,000 spent Annual Fee: $95 Other Benefits and Drawbacks: In addition to the ability to earn points in a wide range of categories, the World of Hyatt credit card offers cardholders a free hotel night valid at Category 1 to 4 Hyatt hotels and the ability to earn a second one after spending $15,000 on the card within a cardmembers anniversary year. Depending on how much you spend on non-Hyatt travel purchases and at restaurants, the Chase Sapphire Reserve could offer you the ability to earn more Hyatt points in a year because Chase Ultimate Rewards points transfer to Hyatt at a 1:1 ratio. U.S. Bank Altitude™ Reserve Visa Infinite® Card * [ jump to details ] The U.S. Bank Altitude Reserve Visa Infinite® Card is the Minneapolis-based bank’s premium travel card offering robust rewards and perks for those who want to squeeze the most value out of their earnings and get some extras to boot. Rewards earned on this card can be redeemed at 50% more value when used for eligible travel and the earnings rate on prepaid rental cars and hotels is among the industry’s highest. Rewards: Earn 5 points per dollar spent on prepaid rental cars and hotels booked through the Altitude rewards center, 3 points per dollar on eligible travel purchases and mobile wallet spending and 1 point per dollar on all other spending. And, through June 30, 2021 earn 3 points per dollar on takeout, food delivery and dining spending. Welcome Offer: Earn 50,000 bonus points worth $750 on travel. Just spend $4,500 in the first 90 days of account opening. Annual Fee: $400 Other Benefits and Drawbacks: The card is only available to applicants who already have an existing U.S. Bank relationship. For the premium price, it lacks travel transfer partners, airport lounge access and is saddled with a minimum redemption amount requirement for hotels and rental cars. It does, however, come with an annual travel redemption credit of up to $325, which could take some of the sting out of the cost of ownership. Read our full review of the U.S. Bank Altitude Reserve . How to Choose a Travel Rewards Card Choosing a travel rewards card is no easy task. There are more cards on the market than we can count, miles and points are not valued the same across programs and programs change how miles can be redeemed regularly. While this list is a great place to start, you’ll also want to ask yourself the following questions. How hard do I want to work? If you want the most bang for your buck (or time), you should consider cards with simple-to-use structures. The Chase Sapphire Cards as well as the Capital One Venture all allow you to redeem your points for any type of travel purchase for good value. It’s possible to get more value out of your rewards using transfer partners, but you’ll have to be prepared to put in the time to learn the programs in order to make sure you’re getting a good deal. How often do you travel? If you only travel once or twice per year, you probably should choose a card with a low annual fee. If you travel more regularly, you’re likely to benefit more from a premium travel rewards card. Do you always fly the same airline? If you always fly the same airline, it may make sense to get that airline’s co-branded credit card, especially if you want access to the airport lounges and free checked bags. If you don’t care about lounge access or checked bags, you might be better off choosing a card that earns points that transfer to your primary airline. Chase Ultimate Rewards transfer to United and American Express Membership Rewards transfer to Delta. If you don’t always fly the same airline, it likely makes sense to get a more flexible travel rewards card. What benefits matter to you and how often will you use them? While travel rewards cards can offer a lot of benefits, these are only benefits if you use them. If you don’t, there’s no reason to have a credit card offering them—especially if it has a sizable annual fee like many in this list. Also be realistic about how often you’ll use the benefits and how much the card is really worth to you. To view rates and fees of the American Express® Gold Card, please visit this page .

Frequently Asked Questions How many miles do you need for a free flight? The number of miles you need for a free flight depends on different factors including which airline miles you are using, where you are flying to and from, when you are traveling and other factors. Domestic flights in the U.S. will generally require fewer miles than an international flight. Typically, count on spending between 4,000 and 20,000 miles for a domestic one-way flight in economy. Long-haul international flights can cost quite a bit more. Plan on spending between 20,000 to 30,000 miles each way to fly to Europe and even more for flights to Asia, Africa, and Oceania. Don’t forget to consider the cost of checked bags and fuel surcharges before booking your ticket. What’s better: cash back or travel rewards? Whether you should earn cash back or travel rewards depends on your personal preferences including when and where you want to travel, how much work you want to put into a redemption and how often you want to be able to use your rewards. As a general rule, using cash back rewards for travel-related purchases would be unwise. Travel rewards typically offer a higher rewards rate for travel-related purchases then a typical cash back rewards card. The inverse is also true. If you are using a travel rewards credit card and redeeming your points for statement credit, you are typically losing out on a higher rewards rate than if you had used a cash back card instead. Therefore, if you’re a frequent traveler, choose a travel rewards card. If traveling is not your thing, a cash back rewards card would be a wiser choice. Keep in mind, you can have both types of cards in your wallet. Are travel rewards credit cards with an annual fee worth the cost? Credit cards with annual fees typically are packed full of benefits that can make paying the annual fee worthwhile as long as you use the benefits offered. Before applying for a card with an annual fee, and regularly while you have the card, look at the benefits that you actually use and weigh those benefits against what you are paying to keep the card open. How do travel rewards credit cards work? A travel rewards credit card accrues miles or points for each purchase made with the card. Often, these cards have an enticing sign-up bonus that typically requires spending a certain amount of money within a specific time period after opening the card. After earning miles or points, there are typically a few redemption options including redeeming for airline tickets, gift cards or statement credits. As a general rule, redeeming miles and points for travel will result in the most value. Why types of travel cards are there? There are two types of travel credit cards. Branded credit cards are specific to one airline or hotel chain. They typically offer less flexible rewards but sometimes offer greater value, especially when considering additional perks of the card like free checked bags or complimentary elite status. Non-branded travel cards typically offer more flexible rewards that can either be transferred to a number of different airlines and hotels or redeemed at a fixed cash-value for travel, gift cards, and/or statement credits. It makes sense to consider the rewards rate, additional perks, you travel patterns and your goals before determining if a branded or non-branded credit card is the best choice for you. It could also make sense to have one (or multiple) of each. What credit score do you need to get a travel rewards credit card? A travel rewards credit card will typically require good to excellent credit in order to qualify. Plan to have a credit score of at least 700 to get approved by the top credit cards on the market. Some of the top travel cards on the market might even require applicants to have a credit score of 720 or higher.
