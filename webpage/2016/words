Alex
is
the
CEO
of
RaySecur,
he
was
previously
Founder
and
CEO
of
FST,
an
MIT
spin-out
company
developing
advanced
sensors
acquired
by
NYSE:
CTS.
He
holds
over
a
dozen
patents
in
the
fields
of
radio
frequency
sensing
and
S.M.
and
Ph.D.
degrees
in
Mechanical
Engineering
from
MIT.
Raysecur
has
developed
breakthrough
imaging
technology
based
on
millimeter
waves.
The
MailSecur
systems
provide
real-time,
3D
imaging
to
detect
even
the
smallest
threats
–
a
vast
improvement
over
traditional
static
2D
X-ray
scanning.
What
initially
attracted
you
to
AI?
I
was
initially
attracted
to
AI
partly
out
of
curiosity
for
what
it
could
enable
and
partly
out
of
necessity
as
a
tool
for
solving
complex
technical
problems. 
At
the
time
I
was
leading
a
team
developing
a
new
type
of
sensing
technology
with
broad
applications
–
from
cars
to
chemical
plants. 
Calibrating
these
sensors
for
a
particular
application
was
very
time
consuming
and
involved
collecting
large
amounts
of
real-world
data
and
then
manually
processing
the
data
to
arrive
at
a
calibration. 
AI
approaches
enabled
a
drastic
reduction
in
calibration
time
and
resulted
in
improved
measurement
accuracy,
while
being
flexible
enough
to
adapt
to
the
diverse
range
of
applications
for
our
sensors.
Since
October
2019,
you’ve
been
the
CEO
of
RaySecur
Inc,
could
you
share
with
us
what
precisely
Raysecur
is?
RaySecur
is
an
early-stage,
venture-backed,
technology
company
based
in
Boston. 
Our
mission
is
to
develop
safe,
effective,
and
scalable
imaging
technologies
to
“see
inside”
items. 
Think
all
of
the
benefits
of
x-ray
imaging
without
any
of
the
drawbacks. 
Using
very
high
frequency
radio-waves
(terahertz)
we
are
able
to
develop
scanners
to
see
inside
items,
such
as
the
contents
of
a
box,
for
example. 
Unlike
x-rays
which
use
harmful
ionizing
radiation,
terahertz
imaging
is
completely
safe. 
The
fact
that
it’s
safe
opens
the
door
to
a
whole
range
of
possibilities
from
real-time
3D
imaging,
to
the
ability
for
people
to
interact
with
an
item
as
they
are
seeing
the
contents
inside
of
it.
Our
flagship
product,
MailSecur
TM
,
is
a
desktop-size
scanner
that
looks
something
like
and
office
copier
or
printer,
but
allows
you
to
see
inside
of
items.
 Anyone
can
simply
hold
an
item
in
the
field
of
view
and
see
a
live
image
of
the
contents
inside
of
it. 
Initial
applications
of
the
technology
include
scanning
mail
for
threats. 
Today
our
systems
are
used
by
many
of
the
world’s
largest
Fortune
500
companies
and
governments,
and
even
to
scan
mail
for
heads
of
state.
Outside
of
our
core
enterprise
applications,
I’m
always
amazed
at
the
wide
range
of
uses
for
our
systems.
  These
have
ranged
from
home
offices
and
vacation
homes
for
high-profile
executives,
to
scanning
mail-in
ballots
for
threats
in
the
2020
presidential
elections,
as
well
as
scanning
mail
on
the
campaign
trail
for
presidential
candidates.
What
are
some
of
the
risk
factors
for
mail-borne
threats?
The
biggest
risk
is
the
fact
that
there
is
very
little
security
when
it
comes
to
physical
items
coming
into
a
building. 
If
you
think
about
it,
it’s
pretty
much
impossible
to
walk
into
a
building
today
without
going
through
multiple
layers
of
security
–
whether
its
checking
in
at
the
front
desk,
badge
access
points,
or
security
guards. 
At
the
same
time,
every
email
you
send
is
scanned
multiple
times
for
viruses,
malware,
and
other
cyber
threats. 
Yet
when
the
mail
arrives,
whether
it’s
a
letter
or
an
Amazon
box,
it
typically
gets
delivered
directly
to
the
recipient
without
any
security
screening. 
That’s
a
huge
risk.
The
problem
is
actually
quite
widespread
–
the
U.S.
Postal
Inspection
Service
(USPIS)
reported
around
3500
dangerous
mail
incidents
last
year
or
roughly
10
per
day
– 
yet
the
issue
generally
gets
little
attention. 
Large
companies,
government
institutions,
and
high-profile
people
are
often
at
greatest
risk. 
Most
threats
come
in
small
envelopes
or
packages,
small
enough
to
fit
in
a
curbside
drop
box. 
Just
last
month
the
New
York
Times
reported
on
Dr.
Anthony
Fauci
ending
up
covered
in
white
powder
after
opening
a
letter,
despite
having
a
dedicated
security
detail
while
working
on
the
coronavirus
task
force.
What
type
of
threats
can
MailSecur
detect?
Our
MailSecur
scanners
are
capable
of
seeing
a
wide
range
of
threats
including
weapons
and
explosives. 
Where
the
technology
really
excels
is
in
imaging
“soft
items”
like
liquids
and
powders
which
make
up
chemical
and
biological
items
as
well
as
hoaxes. 
In
fact
“white
powder”
threats,
like
the
letter
received
by
Dr.
Fauci
last
month
are
some
of
the
most
common
threats
received
in
the
mail. 
This
is
one
area
where
x-ray
systems
struggle
since
x-rays
are
high
energy
and
often
penetrate
right
through
powders
and
liquids
making
them
nearly
invisible,
especially
in
small
quantities
like
those
found
in
the
mail.
How
does
MailSecur
compare
to
traditional
X-ray
scanners?
There
are
a
few
key
differences. 
One
of
the
biggest
differences
is
that
MailSecur
uses
terahertz
imaging
which
is
safe,
unlike
x-ray
scanners
which
use
harmful
ionizing
radiation. 
X-ray
systems
also
require
radiation
permits
and
certifications
before
they
can
be
installed,
and
they
tend
to
be
large
like
the
conveyor
systems
seen
at
airports,
since
they
contain
heavy
lead
liners
to
contain
the
radiation.
X-ray
scanners
also
require
trained
operators
to
interpret
the
static
2-D
images
generated
by
the
system. 
On
the
other
hand,
MailSecur
provides
a
real-time,
3-D
view
of
the
contents
concealed
inside
an
item. 
Because
terahertz
imaging
is
safe,
it
also
allows
you
to
interact
with
the
item
you
are
imaging
–
moving
it
or
rotating
it
to
see
it
from
multiple
angles,
just
like
you
would
interact
with
an
object
in
everyday
life.  
Powders
and
liquids
are
easy
to
see
because
they
move
around
in
the
package. 
This
makes
the
scanner
really
intuitive
and
easy
to
use
with
very
little
training.
Another
key
difference
with
x-ray
scanners,
is
that
the
MailSecur
scanner
is
small
and
portable. 
Just
like
installing
a
desktop
printer,
the
system
can
be
setup
and
running
in
minutes
plugged
in
to
any
standard
wall
outlet. 
Without
the
need
for
permits
and
radiation
safety
certifications,
MailSecur
is
also
much
more
scalable
than
x-ray. 
In
the
past
large
corporations
might
only
have
a
few
x-ray
systems
at
critical
sites,
leaving
the
rest
unprotected. 
MailSecur
is
inherently
scalable,
making
it
easy
to
secure
all
of
a
company’s
facilities
no
matter
where
they
are.
What
are
some
of
the
machine
learning
technologies
that
are
used
with
MailSecur?
We
currently
have
an
active
research
program
supported
by
the
National
Science
Foundation
(NSF)
to
explore
a
number
of
machine
learning
approaches,
given
the
unique
nature
of
our
terahertz
imaging
data
set. 
In
this
case
we
have
a
dynamic
data
set,
with
live
terahertz
video,
as
opposed
to
static
images,
of
concealed
items
in
full-motion. 
As
part
of
this
work,
we
are
also
looking
at
combining
the
terahertz
video
data
with
contextual
information
like
barcode
tracking
and
optical
character
recognition
from
the
mail
item
to
get
smarter
about
the
potential
risk
of
a
particular
item.
Some
of
the
ML
approaches
we
are
using
include
multi-category
classification
to
train
the
systems
to
recognize
certain
features
in
the
terahertz
data
which
might
be
indicative
of
a
threat
to
flag
the
item
as
suspicious. 
Given
the
fact
that
our
systems
need
to
be
capable
of
real-time
classification
in
the
field,
we
have
focused
on
transfer
learning
approaches
to
train
the
system
on
an
initial
data
set
and
further
supplement
this
with
data
as
it
becomes
available
from
the
client. 
Lastly,
we
also
utilize
generative
neural
networks
to
both
enhance
and
tease
out
features
in
the
imaging
data,
which
are
not
obvious
to
someone
looking
at
the
initial
image,
through
a
generative
process.
Our
systems
contain
internal
processing
capabilities
to
run
some
of
these
more
basic
models
in
real-time,
but
are
also
internet
of
things
(IOT)
devices
leveraging
AWS
cloud
services
to
develop
and
train
the
models. 
Aside
form
ML
we
also
apply
a
number
of
advanced
machine
vision
approaches
to
further
enhance
and
augment
threat
detection.
In
2020,
the
United
States
Department
of
Homeland
Security
(DHS)
designated
MailSecur
as
a
Qualified
Anti-Terrorism
Technology
(QATT).
How
important
is
this
for
Raysecur,
and
what
does
it
imply
for
the
company
moving
forward?
 
Following
9/11,
the
SAFETY
(Support
Anti-Terrorism
by
Fostering
Effective
Technologies)
Act
was
created
by
Congress
in
2002
to
encourage
the
creation
of
anti-terrorism
products
and
services.
The
Act
protects
sellers
of
the
technologies
—
and
the
companies
that
buy
and
use
them
—
with
critical
liability
limitations.
For
a
new
technology
like
MailSecur,
achieving
US
DHS
designation
is
extremely
important,
not
only
for
the
liability
protections
it
provides
to
us
and
our
customers,
but
also
for
the
validation
it
provides
in
the
market. 
Specifically,
the
designation
means
that
DHS
has
validated
the
utility
and
effectiveness
of
the
technology
through
both
scientific
studies
and
field
use.
Customers
may
also
be
able
to
attain
lower
insurance
premiums
in
recognition
of
this
significantly
reduced
risk.
Companies
using
security
technologies
that
have
not
been
approved
for
SAFETY
Act
protection
would
not
experience
that
benefit.
Is
there
anything
else
that
you
would
like
to
share
about
RaySecur
or
MailSecur?
In
addition
to
all
the
advantages
of
combining
advanced
AI
approaches
with
cutting-edge
imaging
technology,
it’s
important
to
also
keep
in
mind
the
human
element. 
At
the
end
of
the
day
these
systems,
whether
hardware
or
software,
are
tools
that
help
our
customers
and
their
employees
do
their
jobs
better,
more
effectively,
and
most
importantly
keep
them
safe.
When
it
comes
to
security
applications,
knowing
what
to
do
and
how
to
respond
based
on
the
information
these
new
tools
provides
is
as
important,
if
not
more
important
than
the
tools
themselves. 
We
call
this
creating
actionable
intelligence.
 It
is
for
this
reason,
that
we
have
built
a
team
of
former
military
threat
experts,
who
can
connect
to
any
of
our
scanners
anywhere
in
the
world,
any
time
a
suspicious
item
is
identified. 
These
experts
are
able
to
quickly
assess
the
situation
based
on
the
available
information
to
escalate
or
de-escalate
as
appropriate
to
handle
potential
threats
safely
and
efficiently.
