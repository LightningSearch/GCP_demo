The funding comes courtesy of Great Hill Partners, a private equity firm that specializes in investments in &#8220;high-growth, disruptive companies.&#8221; The investment takes Jumio&#8217;s total funding to more than $255 million, according to Crunchbase. &#8220;Jumio&#8217;s innovations helped establish the identity verification market, and the need to establish someone&#8217;s digital identity remotely has never been greater,&#8221; Jumio CEO Robert Prigge said. The company plans to use the new capital to automate its identity verification solutions, expand the breadth of its Jumio KYX Platform , and further build out the platform&#8217;s suite of AML compliance solutions. As part of the investment, Great Hill Partners&#8217; Nick Cayer and Matt Vettel will join Jumio&#8217;s Board of Directors. Cayer, who has been with Great Hill since 2006, praised the company as &#8220;the de factor global leader in online identity verification, fraud detection, and compliance.&#8221; He added that given the mandate many institutions have to digitize processes such as onboarding and KYC monitoring, firms like Jumio can play a key role in helping them keep pace with the growing volume of digital and mobile-based transactions. Making its Finovate debut in 2013 and being acquired by Centana Growth Partners in 2016, Jumio has verified more than 300 million identities issued by 200+ countries and territories since inception in 2010. With customers and partners in a wide range of verticals &#8211; from financial services and the sharing economy to retail, travel, and online gaming &#8211; Jumio leverages AI, biometrics, machine learning, and certified liveness detection to help ensure that customers are who they claim to be. Jumio&#8217;s KYX Platform, launched last fall , provides organizations with an end-to-end identity verification and eKYC solution that enables them to onboard new accounts safely and accurately, keep existing accounts secure, and meet their compliance obligations with regards to KYC, AML, and GDPR. &#8220;Digital transformation is more than a buzzword. It&#8217;s today&#8217;s business imperative,&#8221; Prigge said. &#8220;To succeed, organizations must transform quickly and do it in ways that build trust, security, and satisfaction. Businesses can tailor the Jumio KYX Platform to fit their unique needs and risks and tap into services that accelerate digital transformation without sacrificing security and convenience.&#8221; Learn more about how Jumio fights deep fakes and bots in our interview from last summer featuring company VP of Marketing, Dean Nicolls.

In a round led by Coatue, Ribbit, and Stripes, digital asset infrastructure specialist Fireblocks has secured $133 million in new capital to power its mission to make it easier for banks to get into the digital asset space. &#8220;Fintechs and banks require not only a specialized custody and settlement infrastructure to ensure customer funds are safely managed, but (also) a platform that enables new lines of digital offerings,&#8221; Fireblocks CEO Michael Shaulov said. He noted that while the company has no plans to become an actual bank itself, &#8220;we believe our infrastructure will lend itself perfectly to power an entirely new era of financial services.&#8221; Also participating in the round as strategic investors were The Bank of New York Mellon and SVB. A number of Fireblocks existing investors also contributed to the round, including Paradigm, Galaxy Digital, Swisscom Ventures, Tenaya Capital and Cyberstarts Ventures. The investment brings the fintech&#8217;s total capital raised to $179 million. Founded in 2018, Fireblocks launched as a digital assets infrastructure company helping crypto-based institutions and exchanges move, store, and issue digital assets. As interest in digital assets &#8211; especially cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum &#8211; has surged, Fireblocks has begun to leverage its talent and technology in digital assets to enable banks and other financial institutions to bring cryptocurrency access to their customers. By linking to its Fireblocks&#8217; platform, banks and fintechs will be able to deploy a wide range of solutions &#8211; from custody, tokenization, and asset management to trading, lending, and payments &#8211; on both public and private blockchain networks. The company&#8217;s investors highlighted Fireblocks&#8217; capacity to enable banks and other financial institutions to efficiently and securely take advantage of the opportunity of and interest in digital assets. CEO of Asset Servicing and Head of Digital for BNY Mellon Roman Regelman said that bridging the gap between traditional and digital assets is &#8220;foundational to the future of custody.&#8221; Coatue Managing Partner Kris Fredrickson concurred: &#8220;our belief (is) that a new financial ecosystem is emerging and (companies) like Fireblocks are essential.&#8221; Last month, Fireblocks announced a partnership with digital payment- platform-as-a-service company, First. Together, the companies introduced a secure wallet and infrastructure solution to enable financial institutions to facilitate transactions via the Diem network . Fireblocks began the year collaborating with global fintech Ibanera to help its customers safely transfer crypto funds in real-time . Since inception, Fireblocks has secured the transfer of more than $400 billion in digital assets. The company is headquartered in New York City.

The $170 million raised this week by Austrian digital asset neobroker Bitpanda is a testament to both the surging interest in cryptocurrencies as well as the vitality of fintech innovation in the CEE countries. Bitpanda&#8217;s Series B round earned the company a valuation of $1.2 billion, giving Austria its first fintech unicorn . The Vienna-based company, founded in 2014 by co-CEOs Eric Demuth and Paul Klanschek, along with CTO Christian Trummer, plans to use the capital to add to the types of investments available on its platform, as well as expand to more markets in Europe. This latest funding round was led by Valar Ventures and featured participation from DST Global. The round is more than triple the amount raised by Bitpanda in its Series A financing back in September, which was also led by Valar Ventures (SpeedInvest of Vienna was an investor in the round, as well). The capital arrives the same week that Bitpanda announced that it had reached a new milestone of more than two million registered users on its Bitpanda and Bitpanda Pro platforms. Bitpanda enables cryptocurrency investors and traders to buy, sell, save, and send more than 50 digital assets including Bitcoin and Ethereum. The neobroker also offers the world&#8217;s first real crypto index and a Bitpanda Card that enables Bitpanda accountholders to spend their digital assets as easily as they spend their cash. With FinovateEurope right around the corner , we&#8217;ve got more than a little continental fintech on the mind these days. This week we take a quick look at fintech news from France, a country whose fintech industry is often overlooked in the broader conversation on European fintech. Earlier this week, we learned that Finovate alum Ledger was launching a new business division dedicated to taking advantage of growing institutional interest in cryptocurrencies . Headquartered in Paris and founded in 2013, the company announced that its Ledger Enterprise Solutions unit will support enterprise adoption of the company&#8217;s core custody technology , Ledger Vault , as well as advise institutional clients with regards to technology implementation, security, and governance of digital asset portfolios. On the French fintech funding beat, PayFit, a payroll and HR platform launched in France in 2016, announced that it has secured $107 million (EUR 90 million) in Series D funding. The investment was led by Eurzeo Growth, Large Venture, and BPI France, and featured participation from the company&#8217;s existing investors Accel, Frst, and individual investor Xavier Niel. The company said that the capital will help support its comprehensive HR solution for SMEs and enable the company &#8211; which also operates in Spain, Germany, the U.K., and Italy &#8211; to &#8220;increase headcount from 550 to 800&#8221; by the end of 2021. PayFit serves more than 5,000 small businesses, and includes Revolut , Starling Bank, and Treatwell among its customers. The company experienced growth of 40% in 2020 &#8211; a pace PayFit anticipates doubling this year &#8211; and credited much of this &#8220;hypergrowth&#8221; to the digital imperative brought on by the COVID-19 crisis. &#8220;As a result of the pandemic, HR professionals have faced a much higher workload and unfamiliar challenges,&#8221; PayFit co-founder and CEO Firmin Zocchetto said . &#8220;They have had to deal with various issues, including supporting the company&#8217;s management with the implementation of remote work policies and ensuring employee wellbeing through new initiatives.&#8221; Zocchetto said that there are &#8220;tens of millions of SMEs&#8221; that are ready for digital transformation. &#8220;The market is huge, and our ambition remains the same: to become the point of reference for payroll and HR management for all SMEs,&#8221; he said. Striking another note in the funding beat, French fintech Silvr announced a EUR 3 million seed investment this week . The company, launched last year by Nima Karimi and Gregory Tappero, provides financing for digital businesses that cannot access traditional bank financing and want to raise equity capital. Silvr offers a revenue-based financing model based on the performance of the financed company, an approach that contrasts with both traditional asset-based lending and fundraising models. Karimi has said that Silvr&#8217;s strategy offers a new option for SMEs in France, calling it simpler and more transparent. Here is our look at fintech innovation around the world.

The platform, Red Hat OpenShift , will enable Nymbus to help its community bank and credit union customers accelerate their digital transformations . &#8220;The COVID-19 pandemic has changed the way we bank, possibly forever,&#8221; Nymbus CEO Jeffery Kendall said. &#8220;It provided the push for local banks and credit unions to establish more secure, flexible, end-to-end digital banking solutions.&#8221; Kendall added that the partnership with Red Hat would give Nymbus&#8217; partners more &#8220;freedom of choice&#8221; in the way they implemented their cloud banking strategies as well as the &#8220;multi-cloud uptime&#8221; Kendall said was &#8220;critical for the banking industry.&#8221; Courtesy of the new partnership, Nymbus customers will be able to deploy and launch a turnkey, digital bank-in-a-box &#8211; running on OpenShift &#8211; on whatever cloud platform they prefer. The open source, cloud-agnostic nature of Red Hat&#8217;s solution helps institutions avoid being dependent on a sole vendor, which can impede innovation. &#8220;Cloud technology is reshaping the way banking services are created and delivered in our digital world,&#8221; Red Hat VP and Global Head of Financial Services Richard Harmon said. &#8220;It is providing service providers the ability to quickly adapt to market changes and make it easier for community banks and credit unions to consume new software.

As part of the company&#8217;s offering, Cheese accountholders get a debit card (issued by Coastal Community Bank), two-day early advance pay with direct deposit, a 3% deposit bonus for referrals, a 0.3% annual percentage yield, and as much as 10% cash back on purchases at more than 10,000 participating merchants. And as part of its pledge to support Asian American communities, Cheese will donate $100,000 to nonprofit organizations and community service programs that support Asian neighborhoods and small businesses &#8211; especially those impacted by COVID-19. Communities in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and New York City are among the first areas of focus. The Asian American community is characterized by its diversity and its rapid growth; there are nearly 21 million Asian Americans in the United States. The relatively high income and education levels common in this community compared to other minority communities in the United States makes them an attractive opportunity for providers in financial services &#8211; from digital banking to wealth management. At the same time, the rising number of incidents of violence against Asian Americans in 2021 are reminders that discrimination and racism against Asian Americans continues to be a challenge in a rapidly-diversifying country. In financial services, this issue often manifests itself most acutely with new Asian immigrants who may have language barriers or lack a credit history and struggle to even secure a bank account. Lian, who immigrated to the U.S. from China in 2008, knows this problem well. &#8220;I had been declined multiple times for basic bank accounts,&#8221; Lian said, &#8220;even with an 800+ FICO score.&#8221; Cheese is headquartered in Pasadena, California. The company was founded in 2019.
