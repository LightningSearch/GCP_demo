have
developed
this
cookie
policy
(the
“Cookie

in
order
to
explain
how
we
use
cookies
and
similar
technologies
(together,
“Cookies”)
on
this
website
(the
“Website”)
and
to
demonstrate
our
firm
commitment
to
the
privacy
of
your
personal
information.
The
first
time
that
you
visit
our
Website,
we
notify
you
about
our
use
of
Cookies
through
a
notification
banner.
By
continuing
to
use
the
Website,
you
consent
to
our
use
of
Cookies
as
described
in
this
Cookie
Policy.
However,
you
can
choose
whether
or
not
to
continue
accepting
Cookies
at
any
later
time.
Information
on
how
to
manage
Cookies
is
set

Cookie

What
are
Cookies?
Cookies
are
small
text
files
containing
user
IDs
that
are
automatically
placed
on
your
computer
or
other
device
when
you
visit
a
website.
The
Cookies
are
stored
by
the
internet
browser.
The
browser
sends
the
Cookies
back
to
the
website
on
each
subsequent
visit,
allowing
the
website
to
recognise
your
computer
or
device.
This
recognition
enables
the
website
provider
to
observe
your
activity
on
the
website,
deliver
a
personalised,
responsive
service
and
improve
the
website.
Cookies
can
be
‘Session
Cookies’
or
‘Persistent
Cookies’.
Session
Cookies
allow
a
website
to
link
a
series
of
your
actions
during
one
browser
session,
for
example
to
remember
the
items
you
have
added
to
a
shopping
basket.
Session
Cookies
expire
after
a
browser
session
and
are
therefore
not
stored
on
your
computer
or
device
afterwards.
Persistent
Cookies
are
stored
on
your
computer
or
device
between
browser
sessions
and
can
be
used
when
you
make
subsequent
visits
to
the
website,
for
example
to
remember
your
website
preferences,
such
as
language
or
font
size.
