Conversational
Ai
Financial
Institutions
Can
Connect
with
Consumers
via
Conversational
Banking
Capability
from
Fiserv
Financial
institutions
can
engage
consumers
in
new
ways
with
a
just-launched
conversational
banking
capability
from&nbsp;
Fiserv,
Inc.
(NASDAQ:
FISV),
a
leading
global
provider
of
financial
services
technology
solutions.
This
solution
speaks
to
the
way
people
want
to
interact
today,
relying
on
natural
language
to
enable
a
range
of
digital
banking
experiences.
Virtual
Banking
Assistant
from
Fiserv,
which
incorporates
ground-breaking
conversational
AI
technology
from&nbsp;
Clinc
,
enables
banks
and
credit
unions
to
have
more
effective
online
conversations
with
their
customers,
a
complementary
alternative
to
face-to-face
customer
interactions
and
a
key
component
of
a
holistic
customer
experience.
Virtual
Banking
Assistant
allows
people
to
interact
with
their
financial
providers
digitally
as
if
they
were
speaking
with
another
person.
Consumers
can
ask
about
account
and
financial
information,
search
for
past
transactions,
view
bills
and
more
with
real-time,
contextual
responses
and
the
option
to
be
transferred
to
live
support
when
needed.
In
this
way,
customers
get
the
support
they
expect
easily
and
without
waiting
in
a
queue.
In
addition,
the
platform
can
provide
actionable,
proactive
insights
to
help
guide
future
spending
and
saving.
“Conversational
banking
is
a
natural
evolution
of
the
digital
banking
experience,
for
many
customers
and
many
types
of
interactions,”
said
Bob
Meara,
senior
analyst
at
Celent.
“More
people
are
looking
to
engage
via
these
types
of
technologies,
and
financial
institutions
are
increasingly
looking
to
deliver
them.
The
potential
benefits
are
huge
in
terms
of
time
savings
and
convenience
for
customers
and
cost
savings
and
customer
satisfaction
for
institutions.”
Rooted
in
Natural
Language
Processing
(NLP),
deep
learning
and
AI
technologies
from
Clinc,
Virtual
Banking
Assistant
is
differentiated
by
a
data-driven
approach
that
doesn’t
rely
on
rigid
scripts,
keyword
matching
or
other
traditional
rules-based
language.
Trained
on
real
examples,
the
software
allows
for
a
more
fluid
and
flexible
approach
that
can
handle
the
messiness
of
spoken
language
and
its
varying
contexts.
“Virtual
Banking
Assistant
combines
conversational
AI
and
proactive
insights
within
one
dynamic
platform,
with
the
ability
to
scale
as
demand
grows,”
said
Ryan
Jandris,
vice
president
of
product
management
for
Digital
Channels
at
Fiserv.
“By
bringing
this
technology
to
market
now,
we
can
enable
banks
and
credit
unions
to
offer
more
innovative
banking
experiences
at
a
time
when
consumers
are
increasingly
engaging
through
digital
channels.”
Offering
an
AI-based
capability
that’s
aligned
with
evolving
consumer
expectations
can
help
financial
institutions
reduce
call
center
volume
and
costs,
as
well
as
maintain
a
competitive
edge.
Beyond
its
consumer-facing
uses
for
retail
banking,
Virtual
Banking
Assistant
also
can
support
internal
processes
of
HR
and
call
routing,
execute
transactions
for
brokers
and
surface
insights
for
wealth
managers.
Virtual
Banking
Assistant
is
immediately
and
exclusively
available
to
Fiserv
clients.
The
platform
integrates
with
digital
banking
solutions
from
Fiserv
including
Architect™,
Corillian
Online
®
&nbsp;and
Mobiliti™
so
financial
institutions
can
create
distinct
digital
experiences
through
a
single
provider.
“Fiserv
has
the
vision,
commitment
to
innovation
and
industry
expertise
required
to
bring
this
solution
to
a
wider
market,”
said
Dr.
Lingjia
Tang,
co-CEO
and
co-founder
of
Clinc.
“Consumers
expect
to
do
everything
they
want
digitally—and
banking
is
no
different.
Every
moment
in
a
customer’s
journey
matters,
and
a
bank’s
ability
to
serve
its
customers
digitally
with
a
meaningful,
informative
experience
has
become
imperative.
By
integrating
conversational
AI
into
its
suite
of
digital
banking
services,
Fiserv
is
changing
the
way
millions
of
account
holders
think
about
and
experience
banking.”

than
ever
before,

helps
clients
deliver
solutions
in
step
with
the
way
people
live
and

today
