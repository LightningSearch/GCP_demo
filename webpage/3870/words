How
to
Compete
in
the
Fast-Growing
Digital
Lending
Market

The
digital
lending
market
is
rapidly
expanding,
growing
at
an
impressive
47%
CAGR,
spurred
by
venture
capital
(VC)
investment,
according
to
the
new
whitepaper
,
European
Digital
Lenders:
How
operating
efficiency
is
helping
digital
lenders
attack
a
$150
billion
annual
origination
market
across
the
Eurozone
in
2018
,
from
analysts
at
the
Fintech
research
practice,
Autonomous
Next.
The
UK
alone
has
an
origination
market
of
$6.6B,
while
across
Europe,
the
addressable
market
is
$150B
and
revenues
are
estimated
at
$400m.
This
represents
a
sizable
opportunity
for
a
competitive
market
that
includes
new
entrants
and
incumbents
alike.
Lenders
who
want
to
remain
competitive
need
to
drive
efficiency
through
digitisation
But
while
the
market
is
growing
quickly,
the
whitepaper
reports
that
digital
lending’s
share
of
the
total
addressable
origination
market
is
still
relatively
low
–
especially
given
the
size
of
the
opportunity.
This
discrepancy
is
attributed
to
the
competitive
nature
of
this
new,
but
rapidly
expanding,
market.
To
remain
competitive
and
profitable,
lenders
need
to
drive
efficiency
through
digitisation.
Efficient
onboarding
and
servicing
using
digitised
workflows,
such
as
digital
identity
verification
technology,
are
being
used
by
both
new
entrants
and
incumbents
to
boost
competitiveness
by
ensuring
regulatory
compliance,
improving
speed,
and
reducing
the
cost
of
customer
acquisition.
In
fact,
the
report
finds
that
digital
identity
verification
can
reduce
KYC/AML
costs
by
up
to
70%,
and
improve
speed
by
80%.
Aplazame,
an
instant
consumer
financing
company
based
in
Spain,
illustrates
an
ideal
example
of
increase
in
customer
acquisition
by
way
of
digitisation
in
their
case
study
.
Spain
sees
massive
online
shopping
cart
abandonment,
with
over
69%
of
carts
abandoned,
representing
a
missed
total
of
approximately
46
billion
euros.
In
order
to
capture
these
lost
opportunities,
Aplazame
needed
to
correctly,
securely
and
quickly
verify
the
identity
of
customers
who
applied
for
credit.
After
adopting
a
secure,
easy-to-use
identity
verification
solution,
they
were
able
to
verify
a
customer’s
identity
in
less
than
20
seconds,
allowing
them
to
offer
instant,
secure
and
streamlined
financing
–
and
ultimately
achieving
a
20%
increase
in
conversions.
Improving
customer
acquisition
and
reducing
KYC/AML
costs
The
report
also
highlights
the
speed
of
onboarding
as
another
competitive
factor
as
processing
times
have
been
drastically
reduced
in
the
digital
world
–
from
a
traditional
six
weeks
to
a
matter
of
minutes.
However,
while
digital
lenders
have
increased
the
speed
of
onboarding,
their
costs
of
acquiring
customers
hasn’t
budged.
On
average,
acquisition
costs
remain
at
$300
per
customer,
which
includes
as
much
as
$150
to
run
KYC
and
AML
checks.
  Another
stumbling
block
many
digital
lenders
face
is
the
high
cost
of
their
capital
is
preventing
digital
lenders
from
competing
with
incumbent
banks
on
price
–
and
this
cost
isn’t
likely
to
drop
anytime
soon,
so
a
savvy
digital
lender
has
to
figure
out
how
to
be
as
efficient
as
possible.
However,
it’s
not
all
doom
and
gloom.
Smart
digital
lenders
are
starting
to
harness
their
lower
operating
costs
to
their
advantage.
For
digital
lenders,
reducing
costs
is
paramount
to
offering
a
real
alternative
to
traditional
banking
providers.
Where
digital
lenders
must
also
play
catch
up
is
with
security
–
and
digital
identity
verification
has
the
potential
to
be
the
tool
to
make
this
happen.
For
digital
lenders,
mandatory
KYC
and
AML
checks
are
still
largely
manual,
building
delays
and
inefficiencies
into
the
onboarding
and
vetting
process.
Combine
these
delays
with
high
costs
per
customer,
and
the
clunky
process
can
prevent
digital
lenders
from
competing
with
incumbent
banks
on
price.
To
gain
an
edge
on
their
competition,
digital
lenders
are
investing
in
identity
verification
solutions,
which
provide
an
opportunity
to
massively
enhance
the
efficiency
of
the
onboarding
process
in
terms
of
both
speed
and
cost
reduction.
Diminishing
inefficiencies
and
offering
better
prices
can
help
drive
a
more
ideal
customer
experience
and
help
to
garner
some
market
share
away
from
traditional
lenders.
Digitisation
can
benefit
industries
beyond
lending
Businesses
from
other
industries,
from
online
marketplaces
and
sharing
economy
platforms,
to
innovative
financial
institutions
like
challenger
banks
and
money
transfer
services,
are
following
suit
as
they
realize
that
the
right
identity
verification
solutions
can
help
them
achieve
compliance,
reduce
fraud,
onboard
more
customers
quickly,
create
trust
and
safety,
and
promote
brand
integrity.
For
example,
global
money
transfer
company
MoneyGram
deployed
Mitek’s
Mobile
Verify®
to
aid
their
organization
in
reducing
friction,
speeding
up
the
verification
process
to
service
more
customers
faster,
and
to
fulfill
regulatory
requirements.
As
a
result,
MoneyGram
saw
a
20%
reduction
in
fraud
loss
and,
more
specifically,
an
80%
reduction
in
account
takeover
fraud
–
as
well
as
a
more
than
70%
increase
in
ID
acceptance
rates.
In
addition
to
reducing
fraud
and
creating
a
safer
platform,
proper
identity
verification
tools
can
help
many
types
of
businesses
more
quickly
build
their
customer
base.
When
blockchain
payment
pioneer
Nocks
began
using
digital
identity
verification,
they
achieved
an
onboarding
speed
of
5
minutes
and
drastically
reduce
its
abandonment
rate,
enabling
them
to
grow
their
customer
base
by
214%
in
just
six
months.
In
this
new
economy,
businesses
need
to
prioritize
their
digital
processes
to
respond
to
consumers
and
regulations.
Digital
identity
and
onboarding,
in
particular
presents
lenders
and
savvy
financial
institutions
the
chance
to
improve
customer
acquisition
funnels,
improve
margins,
mitigate
fraud
risk,
and
meet
regulatory
requirements
while
delivering
a
fast
and
secure
digital
user
experience.
In
the
end,
those
businesses
that
seize
on
the
opportunity
that
digitization
offers
will
be
the
ones
who
hold
the
key
to
success
in
the
age
of
digital
only
lending
and
finance.
