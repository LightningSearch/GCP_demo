Few-shot
learning
refers
to
a
variety
of
algorithms
and
techniques
used
to
develop
an
AI
model
using
a
very
small
amount
of
training
data.
Few-shot
learning
endeavors
to
let
an
AI
model
recognize
and
classify
new
data
after
being
exposed
to
comparatively
few
training
instances.
Few-shot
training
stands
in
contrast
to
traditional
methods
of
training
machine
learning
models,
where
a
large
amount
of
training
data
is
typically
used.
Few-shot
learning
is
used
primarily
in
computer
vision.
To
develop
a
better
intuition
for
few-shot
learning,
let’s
examine
the
concept
in
more
detail.
We’ll
examine
the
motivations
and
concepts
behind
few-shot
learning,
explore
some
various
types
of
few-shot
learning,
and
cover
some
models
used
in
few-shot
learning
at
a
high-level.
Finally,
we’ll
examine
some
applications
for
few-shot
learning.
What
Is
Few-Shot
Learning?
“Few-shot
learning”
describes
the
practice
of
training
a
machine
learning
model
with
a
minimal
amount
of
data.
Typically,
machine
learning
models
are
trained
on
large
volumes
of
data,
the
larger
the
better.
However,
few-shot
learning
is
an
important
machine
learning
concept
for
a
few
different
reasons.
One
reason
for
using
few-shot
learning
is
that
it
can
dramatically
cut
the
amount
of
data
needed
to
train
a
machine
learning
model,
which
cuts
the
time
needed
to
label
large
datasets
down.
Likewise,
few-shot
learning
reduces
the
need
to
add
specific
features
for
various
tasks
when
using
a
common
dataset
to
create
different
samples.
Few-shot
learning
can
ideally
make
models
more
robust
and
able
to
recognize
object-based
on
less
data,
creating
more
general
models
as
opposed
to
the
highly
specialized
models
which
are
the
norm.
Few-shot
learning
is
most
commonly
used
in
the
computer
vision
field,
as
the
nature
of
computer
vision
problems
necessitates
either
large
volumes
of
data
or
a
flexible
model.
Sub-Categories
The
phrase
“few-shot”
learning
is
actually
just
one
type
of
learning
using
very
few
training
examples.
Since
you
are
using
just
“a
few”
training
examples,
there
are
subcategories
of
few-shot
learning
that
also
involve
training
with
a
minimal
amount
of
data.
“One-shot”
learning
is
another
type
of
model
training
that
involves
teaching
a
model
to
recognize
an
object
after
seeing
just
one
image
of
that
object.
The
general
tactics
used
across
one-shot
learning
and
few-shot
learning
are
the
same.
Be
aware
that
the
term
“few-shot”
learning
might
be
used
as
an
umbrella
term
to
describe
any
situation
where
a
model
is
being
trained
with
very
little
data.
Approaches
to
Few-Shot
Learning
Most
few-shot
learning
approaches
can
fit
into
one
of
three
categories:
data-level
approaches,
parameter-level
approaches,
and
metrics-based
approaches.
Data-level
Approaches
Data-level
approaches
to
few-shot
learning
are
very
simple
in
concept.
In
order
to
train
a
model
when
you
don’t
have
enough
training
data,
you
can
just
get
more
training
data.
There
are
various
techniques
a
data
scientist
can
use
to
increase
the
amount
of
training
data
they
have.
Similar
training
data
can
back
up
the
exact
target
data
you
are
training
a
classifier
on.
For
example,
if
you
are
training
a
classifier
to
recognize
specific
kinds
of
dogs
but
lacked
many
images
of
the
particular
species
you
were
trying
to
classify,
you
could
include
many
images
of
dogs
which
would
help
the
classifier
determine
the
general
features
that
make
up
a
dog.
Data
augmentation
can
create
more
training
data
for
a
classifier.
This
typically
involves
applying
transformations
to
existing
training
data,
such
as
rotating
existing
images
so
that
the
classifier
examines
the
images
from
different
angles.
GANs
can
also
be
used
to
generate
new
training
examples
based
on
what
they
learn
from
the
few
authentic
examples
of
training
data
you
have.
Parameter-level
approaches
Meta-learning
One
parameter-level
approach
to
few-shot
learning
involves
the
use
of
a
technique
called
“
meta-learning
”.
Meta-learning
involves
teaching
a
model
how
to
learn
which
features
are
important
in
a
machine
learning
task.
This
can
be
accomplished
by
creating
a
method
to
regulate
how
the
parameter
space
of
a
model
is
explored.
Meta-learning
makes
use
of
two
different
models:
a
teacher
model
and
a
student
model.
The
“teacher”
model
and
a
“student”
model.
The
teacher
model
learns
how
to
encapsulate
the
parameter
space,
while
the
student
algorithm
learns
how
to
recognize
and
classify
the
actual
items
in
the
dataset.
To
put
that
another
way,
the
teacher
model
learns
how
to
optimize
a
model,
while
the
student
model
learns
how
to
classify.
The
teacher
model’s
outputs
are
used
to
train
the
student
model,
showing
the
student
model
how
to
negotiate
the
large
parameter
space
that
results
from
too
little
training
data.
Hence
the
“meta”
in
meta-learning.
One
of
the
main
problems
with
few-shot
learning
models
is
that
they
can
easily
overfit
on
training
data,
as
they
frequently
have
high-dimensional
spaces.
Limiting
the
parameter
space
of
a
model
solves
this
problem,
and
while
it
can
be
accomplished
by
applying
regularization
techniques
and
selecting
the
proper
loss
functions,
the
use
of
a
teacher
algorithm
can
dramatically
improve
the
performance
of
a
few-shot
model.
A
few-shot
learning
classifier
model
(the
student
model)
will
endeavor
to
generalize
based
on
the
small
amount
of
training
data
it’s
provided
with,
and
its
accuracy
can
improve
with
a
teacher
model
to
direct
it
through
the
high
dimensional
parameter
space.
This
general
architecture
is
referred
to
as
a
“gradient-based”
meta-learner.
The
full
process
of
training
a
gradient-based
meta
learner
is
as
follows:
Create
the
base-learner
(teacher)
model
Train
the
base-learner
model
on
the
support
set
Have
the
base-learner
return
predictions
for
the
query
set
Train
the
meta-learner
(student)
on
the
loss
derived
from
the
classification
error
Variations
on
Meta-learning
Model-Agnostic
Meta-learning
is
a
method
used
to
augment
the
basic
gradient-based
meta-learning
technique
we
covered
above.
As
we
covered
above
a
gradient-based
meta-learner
uses
the
prior
experience
gained
by
a
teacher
model
to
fine-tune
itself
and
deliver
more
accurate
predictions
for
a
small
amount
of
training
data.
However,
starting
with
randomly
initialized
parameters
means
that
the
model
can
still
potentially
overfit
the
data.
In
order
to
avoid
this,
a
“Model-agnostic”
meta-learner
is
created
by
limiting
the
influence
of
the
teacher
model/base
model.
Instead
of
training
the
student
model
directly
on
the
loss
for
the
predictions
made
by
the
teacher
model,
the
student
model
is
trained
on
the
loss
for
its
own
predictions.
For
every
episode
of
training
a
model-agnostic
meta-learner:
A
copy
of
the
current
meta-learner
model
is
created.
The
copy
is
trained
with
the
assistance
of
the
base
model/teacher
model.
The
copy
returns
predictions
for
the
training
data.
Computed
loss
is
used
to
update
the
meta-learner.
Metric-Learning
Metric-learning
approaches
to
designing
a
few-shot
learning
model
typically
involve
the
use
of
basic
distance
metrics
to
make
comparisons
between
samples
in
a
dataset.
Metric-learning
algorithms
like
cosine
distance
are
used
to
classify
query
samples
based
on
their
similarity
to
the
supporting
samples.
For
an
image
classifier,
this
would
mean
just
classifying
images
based
on
the
similarity
of
superficial
characteristics.
After
a
support
set
of
images
is
selected
and
transformed
into
an
embedding
vector,
the
same
is
done
with
the
query
set
and
then
the
values
for
the
two
vectors
are
compared,
with
the
classifier
selecting
the
class
that
has
the
closest
values
to
the
vectorized
query
set.
A
more
advanced
metric-based
solution
is
the
“
prototypical
network
”.
Prototypical
networks
cluster
data
points
together
combing
clustering
models
with
the
metric-based
classification
described
above.
Like
in
K-means
clustering,
centroids
for
clusters
are
computed
for
the
classes
in
the
support
and
query
sets.
A
euclidean
distance
metric
is
then
applied
to
determine
the
difference
between
the
query
sets
and
the
centroids
of
the
support
set,
assigning
the
query
set
to
whichever
support
set
classes
are
closer.
Most
other
few-shot
learning
approaches
are
just
variations
on
the
core
techniques
covered
above.
Applications
for
Few-Shot
Learning
Few-shot
learning
has
applications
in
the
many
different
subfields
of
data
science
,
such
as
computer
vision,
natural
language
processing
,
robotics,
healthcare,
and
signal
processing.
Applications
for
few-shot
learning
in
the
computer
vision
space
include
efficient
character
recognition,
image
classification,
object
recognition,
object
tracking,
motion
prediction,
and
action
localization.
Natural
language
processing
applications
for
few-shot
learning
include
translation,
sentence
completion,
user
intent
classification,
sentiment
analysis,
and
multi-label
text
classification.
Few-shot
learning
can
be
used
in
the
robotics
field
to
help
robots
learn
about
tasks
from
just
a
few
demonstrations,
letting
robots
learn
how
to
carry
out
actions,
move,
and
navigate
the
world
around
them.
Few-shot
drug
discovery
is
an
emerging
area
of
AI
healthcare.
Finally,
few-shot
learning
has
applications
for
acoustic
signal
processing,
which
is
the
process
of
analyzing
sound
data,
letting
AI
systems
clone
voices
based
on
just
a
few
user
samples
or
voice
conversion
from
one
user
to
another.
