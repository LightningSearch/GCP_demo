These are the details. Shares of Nio Inc (NYSE: NIO) recently received a price target decrease from $75 to $70 by JPMorgan. And JPMorgan analyst Nick Lai maintained an “Overweight” rating on the shares. Over the past 5 trading days, the stock price of Nio fell by 19.73%. Investors were particularly responding to quarterly results that were below expectations. While Nio’s Q4 revenues of $1.02 billion slightly beat expectations, the 17,353 vehicles that the company delivered in the quarter had costed the company a GAAP net loss of $0.16 per share and adjusted loss of $0.14 per share. Analysts were expecting $0.07. Looking past the net loss, Lai pointed out that Nio had grown its sales 133% year-over-year and the company turned its Q4 gross profit from last year into a positive gross margin of 17.2% for the quarter. Plus Lai noted that the operating losses fell by 67% and net losses fell by 52%, according to TipRanks . Lai said that Nio’s fourth quarter was solid and it has a “meaningful beat” if you back out the &#8220;unrealized foreign exchange losses,” which was the primary reason Nio lost twice as much money as analysts had anticipated.   Nio also guided over 20,000 vehicle deliveries for Q1 2021 so Lai is optimistic about the company. However, Lai acknowledged that the shortage of automotive semiconductor chip supplies could hinder Nio from achieving its goals in the short-term.
