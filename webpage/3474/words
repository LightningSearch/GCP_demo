Shares
of
Nio
Inc
(NYSE:
NIO)
recently
received
a
price
target
decrease
from
$75
to
$70
by
JPMorgan.
These
are
the
details.
Shares
of
Nio
Inc
(NYSE:
NIO)
recently
received
a
price
target
decrease
from
$75
to
$70
by
JPMorgan.
And
JPMorgan
analyst
Nick
Lai
maintained
an
“Overweight”
rating
on
the
shares.
Over
the
past
5
trading
days,
the
stock
price
of
Nio
fell
by
19.73%.
Investors
were
particularly
responding
to
quarterly
results
that
were
below
expectations.
While
Nio’s
Q4
revenues
of
$1.02
billion
slightly
beat
expectations,
the
17,353
vehicles
that
the
company
delivered
in
the
quarter
had
costed
the
company
a
GAAP
net
loss
of
$0.16
per
share
and
adjusted
loss
of
$0.14
per
share.
Analysts
were
expecting
$0.07.
Looking
past
the
net
loss,
Lai
pointed
out
that
Nio
had
grown
its
sales
133%
year-over-year
and
the
company
turned
its
Q4
gross
profit
from
last
year
into
a
positive
gross
margin
of
17.2%
for
the
quarter.
Plus
Lai
noted
that
the
operating
losses
fell
by
67%
and
net
losses
fell
by
52%,
according
to
TipRanks
.
Lai
said
that
Nio’s
fourth
quarter
was
solid
and
it
has
a
“meaningful
beat”
if
you
back
out
the
&#8220;unrealized
foreign
exchange
losses,”
which
was
the
primary
reason
Nio
lost
twice
as
much
money
as
analysts
had
anticipated.
 
Nio
also
guided
over
20,000
vehicle
deliveries
for
Q1
2021
so
Lai
is
optimistic
about
the
company.
However,
Lai
acknowledged
that
the
shortage
of
automotive
semiconductor
chip
supplies
could
hinder
Nio
from
achieving
its
goals
in
the
short-term.
