Teaching
Kids
the
Imitation
Game:
The
Importance
of
Educating
Students
about
Artificial
Intelligence
Albert
Lee
knows
a
lot
about
education.
As
an
AI
training
engineer
for
Clinc,
he
spends
his
days
helping
grow
the
company’s
artificial
intelligence
software
through
machine
learning
and
training
data.
However,
Albert
doesn’t
only
help
machines
learn.
He
also
devotes
a
lot
of
his
time
to
teaching
computer
science
and
artificial
intelligence
to
middle-schoolers.
Albert
is
currently
teaching
a
virtual
class
for
sixth
through
eighth
graders
that
he
developed
in
partnership
with
the
Detroit
Area
Pre-College
Engineering
Program
(DAPCEP)
,
a
nonprofit
organization
devoted
to
STEM
education
with
more
than
40
years
of
experience
partnering
with
universities,
training
programs,
and
K-12
school
systems.
Albert
says
that
the
class
is
“a
great
opportunity
for
young
students
to
experience
machine
learning
and
build
cool
applications.”
We
recently
sat
down
with
Albert
to
talk
about
his
educational
outreach
work
and
why
it’s
important
to
introduce
kids
to
the
concept
of
AI
at
a
young
age.
Here’s
what
he
told
us:
Why
do
you
think
it&#8217;s
important
to
get
STEM
students
thinking
about
concepts
like
artificial
intelligence
in
middle
school?
Albert:
The
short
answer
is
“Why
not?”
Artificial
intelligence
is
a
fun
topic.
But
also,
when
you’re
working
with
younger
kids,
it’s
much
easier
to
develop
curiosity
around
the
topic.
When
you
start
thinking
about
AI
with
older
age
groups,
they
can
start
focusing
too
much
on
the
applications
or
how
it
applies
to
their
futures
or
careers.
With
young
kids,
we
get
a
lot
of
wild
questions,
which
is
great.
I
really
encourage
my
kids
to
explore
and
try
to
break
things
when
they’re
working
on
our
projects.
I
don’t
want
them
to
be
afraid
to
try
things.
How
do
you
teach
a
concept
as
big
and
complex
as
artificial
intelligence
to
a
sixth-grader?
Albert:
What
I
really
enjoy
about
teaching
AI
is
that
everything
within
artificial
intelligence
is
actually
just
an
imitation
of
actual
intelligence,
right?
So,
you
get
to
have
these
really
bright
discussions
about
what
human
intelligence
actually
is
and
how
we,
as
humans,
understand
the
world
around
us.
One
of
the
exercises
I
do
with
the
kids
is
an
animal
identification
project.
Together,
we
work
to
build
an
image
recognition
model
that
can
tell
the
difference
between
a
jaguar
and
a
leopard.
I
mean,
they’re
both
cats
with
spots.
So,
we
gather
training
data,
we
work
to
train
a
machine
learning
model.
Even
if
you
personally
don’t
know
the
difference
between
the
cats,
you
can
train
a
machine
learning
model
to
recognize
that
difference.
It’s
a
really
good
activity
to
get
kids
to
see
the
value
in
AI.
Another
activity
we
do
is
an
extremely
simplified
version
of
the
conversational
AI
we
develop
at
Clinc.
I
have
our
students
create
their
own
imaginary
friend
and,
through
gathering
data
and
machine
learning,
we
can
actually
train
that
virtual
AI
friend
to
answer
basic
questions
over
the
phone.
What
does
it
actually
mean
to
“train”
AI?
Albert:
As
a
human,
one
of
the
things
we
do
is
we
learn
from
our
experience,
right?
For
example,
if
you
go
to
a
bank
teller,
you
know
exactly
what
type
of
interactions
to
expect
because
you’ve
been
to
a
bank
many
times
before,
so
you&#8217;ve
learned
from
those
past
experiences.
With
machine
learning,
our
AI
models
learn
from
experience,
but
that
experience
has
been
coded
into
what
we
call
training
data.
So,
instead
of
having
to
actually
programmatically
code
all
of
those
instructions,
you
train
your
AI
model
on
what
you
want
it
to
do
by
providing
it
with
training
data.
What
I
enjoy
most
about
artificial
intelligence
goes
back
to
that
theme
of
AI
as
an
imitation
of
humans.
One
of
the
cool
things
about
Clinc’s
conversational
AI
technology
is
how
its
built
in
the
same
way
that
you
actually
experience
conversations.
It’s
aligned
with
how
humans
really
interact
in
person
and
that’s
a
fun
concept
to
convey
to
students
who
are
trying
to
wrap
their
heads
around
the
technology.
If
your
students
could
only
walk
away
from
your
class
with
one
major
insight
into
AI,
what
would
you
want
it
to
be?
Albert:
I
mean,
first
and
foremost,
I
want
them
to
understand
that
AI
is
fun
and
you
can
use
it
to
build
really
cool
stuff.
AI
is
super
interesting
because
it’s
an
imitation
of
what
humans
do
and
you
can
use
it
as
a
tool
to
create
whatever
you
want
to
create.
That’s
a
powerful
thing
for
kids
to
understand
and
that’s
why
I
love
teaching
classes
like
this.
But
I’m
not
doing
it
on
my
own.
Volunteers
are
so
essential
to
these
kinds
of
classes,
particularly
virtual
classes,
to
help
guide
the
students
in
breakout
groups
or
projects.
We
have
a
lot
of
volunteers
from
Clinc
working
with
my
students,
but
we
also
have
virtual
volunteers
from
other
companies
and
even
other
countries.
I
currently
have
one
volunteer
from
the
UK
and
another
from
South
Africa.
They’re
very
generous
with
their
time.
There
is
a
real
community
out
there
that
is
devoted
to
teaching
kids
about
AI
and
I’m
happy
to
be
a
part
of
it.
