New
Intel
CEO
pledges
$20B
in
Fab
investments.
Is
that
enough?
What’s
next?
Newly
installed
Intel
CEO
Pat
Gelsinger
didn’t
waste
any
time
announcing
that
his
top
priority
will
be
to
“fix”
the
company’s
manufacturing
shortcomings
which
have
delayed
recent
products
by
well
over
a
year.
I
think
he
announced
a
good
start,
but
frankly
previous
leaders
have
said
they
have
a
plan
to
fix
this
before.
Let’s
take
a
look
at
what
might
different
this
time
around.
What
Did
Intel
Announce?
First
and
foremost,
Gelsinger
made
it
clear
that
the
company
plans
to
maintain
its
role
as
an
integrated
device
manufacturer
(IDM),
quashing
any
rumors
that
Intel
might
sell
or
spin
out
its
massive
fabrication
facilities.
Intel’s
manufacturing
prowess
has
provided
a
significant
competitive
advantage
in
the
past,
and
Gelsinger
believes
it
will
again
in
the
future.
Shareholders
and
customers
surely
hope
he
is
right,
however
he
faces
a
monumental
challenge:
Intel’s
first
7nm
product,
Meteor
Lake,
will
not
ship
before
2023,
at
least
three
years
later
than
key
competitors
including
AMD
and
NVIDIA.
Meanwhile
Intel
will
increase
the
use
of
Taiwan
Semiconductor
Manufacturing
Corporation
(TSMC)
for
chips
such
as
the
upcoming
Ponte
Vecchio
GPU
and
Habana
Labs
AI
ASICs
and
others
yet
to
be
announced.
To
demonstrate
this
commitment,
Gelsinger
promised
Intel
would
invest
some
$20B
in
two
new
manufacturing
facilities
Arizona.
In
my
mind,
that
sounds
like
business
as
usual.
However,
he
also
announced
new
Intel
Foundry
Services
to
enable
outside
use
of
x86
core
technologies,
including
the
latest
CPU
technologies,
although
timing
of
that
move
was
left
vague.
Gelsinger
also
announced
that
the
venerated
but
discontinued
Intel
Developers
Forum
(IDF)
will
be
rebooted
later
this
year
as
“Intel
ON”.
This
is
a
great
move
in
my
opinion,
as
the
cost
cutting
elimination
of
IDF
was
universally
panned
as
being
short
sighted
and
significantly
reduced
education
and
teamwork
within
the
development
ecosystem.
Gelsinger
led
the
original
formation
of
IDF,
so
I’m
sure
it
was
on
his
list
of
low-hanging
fruit.

Intel
has
announced
the
company's
strategy
to
"unleash"
its
manufacturing
potential.

Stumbles
In
Ripple
Case,
Lost
In
A
Maze
Of
Its
Own
Making
Finally,
and
perhaps
most
intriguing,
Intel
announced
that
it
will
partner
with
IBM
on
research
projects
for
semiconductor
manufacturing
and
technologies.
Intel
and
IBM
represent
a
significant
portion
of
the
industry’s
hardware
research
personnel
and
patents,
so
this
could
be
a
powerful
alliance.
Specifically,
I
hope
this
collaboration
provides
an
avenue
to
productize
some
of
the
impressive
IBM
Research
technologies
in
AI
and
memory
I
have
covered
previously
on
these
pages.
What
Might
Be
Different
This
Time
Around?
While
I
am
frankly
a
bit
ambivalent
about
the
decision
to
retain
and
double-down
on
the
IDM
strategy
(new
semi
leaders
such
as
AMD
and
NVIDIA
have
long
abandoned
this
approach),
I
am
happy
to
see
that
the
last
great
USA
semiconductor
fabricator
plans
to
remain
standing.
I
suspect
the
US
Biden
administration
feels
relieved
as
well.
The
country’s
global
market
competitive
position
cannot
risk
over
dependence
on
foreign
manufacturing
of
technology
as
critical
as
semiconductors.
So,
what
could
make
the
outcome
different
this
time
around?
First,
in
a
nod
to
AMD’s
successful
model,
Intel
has
shifted
its
design
strategy
from
building
monolithic
dies
to
a
chiplet
approach
Intel
calls
“tiles”.
For
example,
the
upcoming
Ponte
Vecchio
GPU
consists
of
over
40
tiles
in
a
package.
At
some
point,
I
expect
Intel
to
adopt
thsi
approach
in
desktop
and
server
CPUs
to
be
build
in
Intel
Fabs,
which
will
greatly
reduce
the
pressure
on
the
manufacturing
process
as
well
as
engineering.
Think
of
this
as
a
System
on
a
Package,
a
high-level
version
of
a
System
on
a
Chip
(SoC).
Second,
the
commitment
to
provide
fab
capacity
and
IP
services
to
the
industry
should
help
the
company
finance
additional
investments,
keeping
the
fabs
humming
along
even
as
Intel
outsources
some
of
its
designs
to
spread
the
risk.
I
think
that
without
this
move,
the
long-term
viability
of
Intel
fabs
would
have
to
be
doubtful.
Third,
never
underestimate
the
power
of
a
wise
leader.
Gelsinger
certainly
understands
that
competitive
manufacturing
capabilities
may
be
necessary
for
Intel’s
success,
but
will
prove
insufficient
to
ensure
it.
The
company
has
design
and
product
portfolio
issues
as
well
that
must
be
resolved
quickly,
lest
the
firm
put
non-competitive
products
into
the
factory.
Ponte
Vecchio
and
Habana
Gaudi
hold
tremendous
potential,
and
now
the
company
must
execute.
This
is
also
where
Gelsinger’s
leadership
will
come
into
play.`
In
Conclusion
Gelsinger
did
what
he
had
to
do:
communicate
that
he
“gets
it”
and
is
making
the
investments
to
fix
Intel’s
foundation
instead
of
abandoning
it.
Now
he
must
tackle
the
rest
of
the
story:
his
vast
engineering
teams
must
be
coached
to
row
together,
in
one
direction.
This
is
especially
critical
in
the
area
of
artificial
intelligence,
where
the
company
has
repeatedly
misfired.
The
company
now
can
not
afford
to
miss
the
most
important
boat
in
the
harbor:
creating
chips
and
software
that
can
usher
in
Software
2.0.
