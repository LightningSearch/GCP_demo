Pre-Market:
Why
It
Happened
The
stock
price
of
RLX
Technology
Inc.
(NYSE:
RLX)
fell
by
over
25%
pre-market.
This
is
why
it
happened.
The
stock
price
of
RLX
Technology
Inc.
(NYSE:
RLX)
fell
by
over
25%
pre-market.
Investors
appear
to
be
responding
to
a
Reuters
report
that
Chinese
regulators
are
planning
to
bring
the
rules
governing
the
sales
of
e-cigarettes
and
other
tobacco
products
in
line
with
those
for
regular
cigarettes.
The
Ministry
of
Industry
and
Information
Technology
(MIIT)
and
China’s
State
Tobacco
Monopoly
Administration
had
posted
online
the
draft
regulations
that
could
negatively
impact
a
fast-growing
industry.
A
couple
of
years
ago,
several
Chinese
e-cigarette
companies
had
emerged
in
targeting
the
domestic
market
after
the
success
of
the
Juul.
RLX
Technology
had
raised
$1.4
billion
in
an
IPO
in
January
that
that
valued
the
company
at
$35
billion.
China’s
tobacco
industry
is
controlled
entirely
by
a
government
monopoly.
And
there
are
strict
controls
determining
which
companies
and
retailers
can
produce
and
sell
cigarettes.
Cigarette
sales
had
generated
5.45%
of
China’s
overall
tax
revenue
in
2018.
And
so
industry
experts
have
long
expected
the
state
to
intervene
in
the
business
operations
of
China’s
private
e-cigarette
companies.
In
November
2019,
Chinese
regulators
had
forbid
e-commerce
platforms
from
selling
e-cigarette
products
online.
And
this
ban
curbed
the
growth
of
the
market.
So
many
brands
focused
their
business
toward
offline
sales.
