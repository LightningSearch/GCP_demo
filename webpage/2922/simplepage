Our main criteria relate to value: Will any fees you pay for this card be outweighed by the benefits you will receive? We also evaluated each category of card within its lane, meaning comparing hotel cards to hotel cards, cash back cards to cash back cards, and the like. Other characteristics taken into consideration while judging each category were accessibility, dollar value of cash back or point rewards, APR, fees and additional benefits or protections offered by the card. Finally, we considered auxiliary features within each category such as elite status or lounge access with travel cards. Best Business Credit Cards 2021 American Express&reg; Business Gold Card [ jump to details ] The American Express® Business Gold Card is a solid option for business owners who want to maximize their earnings but don’t want to put a lot of thought into it. American Express automatically rewards you at a generous 4 Membership Rewards points per dollar on your top two categories of spending from a selected list, chosen automatically each month in the areas you spend the most. Many cards offer quarterly or rotating bonus categories, but the American Express Business Gold Card does the work for you. Rewards: Earn 4 Membership Rewards points on two select categories where you spend most each month (automatically determined by Amex). 4X points apply to the first $150,000 in combined purchases from these 2 categories each calendar year. Earn 1 point per dollar on all other purchases. Welcome Offer: Earn 70,000 Membership Rewards® points after you spend $10,000 on eligible purchases with the Business Gold Card within the first 3 months of Card Membership. Terms Apply Annual Fee: $295 (see rates and fees ) Other Benefits and Drawbacks: A notable travel perk the Amex Business Gold has is 25% of the points you use when you book eligible flights with Amex Travel back, up to 250,000 points back per calendar year. American Express also grants users travel and transportation protections, such as baggage insurance, emergency assistance and no foreign transaction fees. Additionally, American Express has one of the most robust benefits programs out there with protections including purchase protection and extended warranty coverage. Cardholders have the ability to pay balances over time with interest, and there are no pre-set spending limits on the Business Gold card. Ink Business Cash&reg; Credit Card [ jump to details ] If you want a no annual fee card that allows you to earn valuable rewards, Ink Cash is a good option. This card is marketed as a cash back card, but can be paired with a premium Chase Ultimate Rewards-earning card to unlock the full value of Chase Ultimate Rewards points. The card also offers protections that you don’t often see on a no-annual-fee card including primary car rental insurance for your business and purchase protection. Rewards: Earn 5% cash back on the first $25,000 spent in combined purchases at office supply stores and on internet, cable and phone services each account anniversary year. Earn 2% cash back on the first $25,000 spent in combined purchases at gas stations and restaurants each account anniversary year. Earn 1% cash back on all other purchases. Welcome Offer: Earn $750 bonus cash back after you spend $7,500 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening Annual Fee: $0 Other Benefits and Drawbacks: The 5% and the 2% category each have an annual limit of $25,000 spent in combined purchases. While the card is marketed as a cash back card, it actually earns Ultimate Rewards. Ultimate Rewards from the Chase Ink Cash must be combined with personal Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card or Chase Sapphire Reserve® points in order to utilize airline partner transfers where they can be worth more than 1 cent each. If you’re just looking for one card, the Ink Business Cash Card could still be a good option if you regularly spend in the bonus categories but don’t think you’ll exceed the $25,000 annual caps. If that doesn’t sound like you, you should look elsewhere. Ink Business Unlimited&reg; Credit Card [ jump to details ] The Chase Ink Business Unlimited Credit Card is marketed as a cash back card, and offers a relatively high rate of cash back. When paired with a premium Chase Ultimate Rewards-earning card like the Ink Business Preferred®, Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card or Chase Sapphire Reserve®, earnings can be taken as Ultimate Rewards points which can make this card even more valuable. The Unlimited tops the Ink Preferred if you want a straightforward earnings rate rather than bonus categories as long as you pair it with a card that has transferable rewards. Rewards: Earn 1.5 Ultimate Rewards points per dollar spent on all purchases. Welcome Offer: Earn $750 bonus cash back after you spend $7,500 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening Annual Fee: $0 Other Benefits and Drawbacks: The “set it and forget it” rewards from the Chase Ink Unlimited couldn’t be easier to earn, making this a solid choice if you only want one business card but want to earn variable rewards. That said, you’ll need to pair it with another Ultimate Rewards-earning card with transferable points if you want to unlock the full potential of this card. If you’re after the highest rate of cash back alone, it’s possible that another card would provide more value. Read our Ink Business Unlimited Credit Card review to learn more. The Blue Business&reg; Plus Credit Card from American Express [ jump to details ] The Blue Business® Plus Credit Card from American Express is interesting because you can earn Membership Rewards points without paying an annual fee. The card also offers an introductory APR offer, which allows a new business to acquire inventory or pay upfront expenses with time to pay them off without interest. Rewards: Earn 2 Membership Rewards® points on your first $50,000 in purchases each year, regardless of the category. If you hit the threshold, you’ll still earn 1 point per dollar thereafter. Welcome Offer: N/A Annual Fee: No annual fee (see rates and fees ) Other Benefits and Drawbacks: This card’s intro APR of 0% on purchases for 12 months from date of account opening followed by an ongoing APR of 13.24% - 19.24% Variable can be enticing if you want to save money on interest with a lower APR, but carrying a balance isn’t going to be a good idea in the long-run when the introductory period is over. One downside of this card is the fact that you won’t earn any kind of welcome bonus if you’re approved and meet a minimum spending requirement. We do like the fact you can earn 2 Membership Rewards® points per dollar on everyday business purchases such as office supplies or client dinners. The 2 points per dollar rate applies to the first $50,000 in purchases per year, the card earns 1 point per dollar thereafter. If your business regularly spends more than $50,000 per year, a card without a cap may be a better choice Ink Business Preferred&reg; Credit Card [ jump to details ] The Chase Ink Business Preferred® Credit Card offers the ability to earn valuable Chase Ultimate Rewards points at compelling rates and an impressive bonus offer, making it a top pick for business travel. Ultimate Rewards are valuable because they are so flexible. You can redeem directly for travel at 1.25 cents per point through Chase or transfer to over a dozen loyalty programs including United, Southwest and Hyatt. Rewards: Earn 3 Ultimate Rewards points per dollar spent on travel purchases and select business categories on the first $150,000 spent each account anniversary year and 1 Ultimate Rewards point per dollar on all other purchases. Welcome Offer: Earn 100k bonus points after you spend $15,000 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening. That's $1,000 cash back or $1,250 toward travel when redeemed through Chase Ultimate Rewards® Annual Fee: $95 Other Benefits and Drawbacks: The “select business categories” include shipping, internet, cable and phone, and social media and search engine advertising. If your business does a lot of online advertising, this card will rake in the rewards. Ultimate Rewards from the Chase Ink Preferred can be combined with personal Ultimate Rewards points to help grow balances quickly. This card also offers cell phone insurance limited to three claims of up to $600 each per year, subject to a $25 deductible. This card also offers trip cancellation and interruption insurance, primary auto rental insurance when you rent for business purposes (secondary if you’re renting for personal reasons), purchase protection and extended warranty coverage. Read our review of the Ink Business Preferred Credit Card to learn more. The Business Platinum Card® from American Express * [ jump to details ] The Business Platinum Card® from American Express does come with a pricey annual fee, but it can be a value for anyone who travels frequently and wants access to luxury travel perks. This card comes with access to the prestigious Centurion Lounges among over 1,000 others and comes with an array of credits you can use to help justify paying the annual fee. The biggest downside of this card is the fact that the credits are so specific. Rewards: Earn 5 Membership Rewards® points per dollar on flights and prepaid hotels on amextravel.com. Earn 1.5 points per dollar on each eligible purchase of $5,000 or more. You can get up to 1 million additional points per year. All other purchases earn 1 point per dollar. Welcome Offer: Earn 85,000 Membership Rewards® points after you spend $15,000 on eligible purchases with the Business Platinum Card plus earn 5x points on eligible purchases in 5 select business categories, up to 80,000 bonus points per category, all within the first 3 months of Card Membership. Terms Apply. Annual Fee: $595 (see rates &amp; fees ) Other Benefits and Drawbacks: The Business Platinum Card shines when you get to the airport. Not only will you be able to access Priority Pass lounges worldwide after you enroll, but you can also use American Express Centurion Lounges and even Delta SkyClubs when you fly Delta. This card comes with an array of travel credits you can use each year, a fee credit for Global Entry or TSA PreCheck and a $200 airline credit for incidentals with an eligible airline you must select each year. You’ll also get Gold status with the Marriott Bonvoy and Hilton Honors hotel programs when you enroll, as well as up to $200 in statement credits for U.S. Dell purchases and 35% of your points back, up to 500,000 bonus points per calendar year, when you redeem them for airfare through AmexTravel.com . The Hilton Honors American Express Business Card [ jump to details ] If you prefer full-service hotels to roadside rest stops, the Hilton Honors American Express Business Card is worth exploring. This card gives you complimentary Hilton Gold Status as a cardholder, and you can earn a generous welcome bonus and a high rate of rewards on all your spending. Rewards: Earn 12 Hilton Honors points per dollar spent on Hilton purchases, 6 points per dollar at U.S. gas stations, U.S. wireless telephone services, U.S. shipping, U.S. restaurants, flights booked directly with the airline or with AmexTravel.com and car rentals booked directly with the car rental company; earn 3 points per dollar on all other purchases. Welcome Offer: Earn a $150 statement credit after your first purchase on the Hilton Honors Card within your first 3 months. Plus, earn 150,000 Hilton Honors Bonus Points after you spend $2,000 in purchases on the Card within your first 3 months of Card Membership. Annual Fee: $95 (see rates and fees ) Other Benefits and Drawbacks: This card can be worth it for the welcome bonus alone, but don’t forget that you’ll also get automatic Hilton Gold Status. This elite status can afford you benefits like late checkout, complimentary breakfast at Hilton properties, room upgrades based on availability and more. Even if you’re just an occasional Hilton guest, this card could make sense. You’ll also get 10 complimentary visits to Priority Pass lounges per year, which is unusual for a mid-range credit card and can be more than enough to get you into airport lounges anytime you want if you only travel a few times per year. If you do travel more than once per month, however, you may want to consider a travel credit card with a Priority Pass Select membership that includes unlimited visits. For more information, check out our Amex Hilton Business Card review. United Club℠ Business card * [ jump to details ] The United Club Business card is a brother to the personal United Club℠ Infinite Card, with a slightly different earning structure. The high annual fee plus the other United perks would easily outweigh the annual fee if you would normally pay for a United Club membership anyway. If your business is not near a United hub, this card may not be for you. Rewards: Earn 2 United MileagePlus miles per dollar spent on United Airlines purchases and 1.5 miles per dollar spent on all other purchases. Welcome Offer: Earn 50,000 bonus miles after you spend $3,000 on purchases in the first 3 months your account is open Annual Fee: $450 Other Benefits and Drawbacks: The United Club Business Card has pumped-up benefits, but charges a steep annual fee. Besides Club Membership, the Business Club card offers Premier Access at the airport, space-available upgrades on award tickets, your free first and second checked bags, 25% off in-flight purchases and Hertz President’s Circle. This card also comes with a suite of travel and purchase protections including trip cancellation and interruption insurance, trip delay coverage, lost and damaged baggage insurance, delayed baggage coverage, rental car insurance coverage, purchase protection, return protection and extended warranty. Capital One® Spark® Cash for Business * Small business owners are busy, meaning choosing and using a card with complex category rewards may not be worth the time required to do so effectively. The Capital One® Spark® Cash for Business is a great fit for small businesses looking for a simple yet generous cash back rewards program and a low APR. It’s also a fit for businesses that spend heavily as there is no maximum amount you can earn. Rewards: Earn unlimited 2% cash back that can be redeemed any time and with no minimums. Welcome Offer: Earn a one-time $500 cash bonus once you spend $4,500 on purchases within 3 months from account opening Annual Fee: $0 intro for first year, $95 after that Other Benefits and Drawbacks: Other benefits of this card include employee cards at no additional cost, meaning small business owners can earn more cash back faster. Cash back rewards can be redeemed at any time and have no expiration date. A downside, however, is this card isn’t for a businesses or owner with less than stellar credit. With its recommendation for “good” to “excellent” credit,’ the Capital One Spark Cash for Business might only work for businesses and owners with first-rate credit histories. Read our Capital One Spark Cash for Business review to learn more. Wyndham Rewards® Earner℠ Business Card * [ jump to details ] The Wyndham Earner Business card has unmatched earnings in categories that cater to those who live in their cars. With an industry-leading bonus on gas station purchases and healthy earning on Wyndham hotel stays, the card is a no-brainer if you are comfortable in the budget hotels that make up the vast majority of Wyndham’s portfolio and spend a lot of time on the road. Rewards: Earn 8 Wyndham Rewards points per dollar spent at gas station and Wyndham hotel purchases; 5 points per dollar on marketing, advertising and utilities, and 1 point per dollar everywhere else. Welcome Offer: Earn 45,000 bonus points, enough for up to six free nights at participating Hotels By Wyndham, after spending $1,000 on purchases in the first 90 days Annual Fee: $95 Other Benefits and Drawbacks: With 15,000 anniversary points and a 10% discount on go free rewards at Wyndham hotels, you’ll have access to free nights faster than you can say “Super-8.” Since basic hotels start at 7,500 points per night, it takes less than $1,000 in spending on gas or at Wyndham hotels to earn a free night. That’s an unheard-of rate, as long as you’re not looking for luxury. If self-parking is your idea of roughing it, the Wyndham card is not for you. How to pick a business credit card With the many different types of credit cards available, picking one for a business can be a lengthy process. Prospective cardholders have multiple factors to take into consideration before landing on a best-pick, including: How much will the card cost per year? Annual fees often cover membership benefits offered by cards. Prospective cardholders should calculate how much they’ll need to spend in order to accumulate enough rewards or cash back to offset the fee. How much will additional cards cost? Adding additional employee cards to an account can be a smart way to generate more rewards, but confirm how much each additional card will cost per year. How much are membership or rewards points worth? Some cards have high points per dollar offers, but when it comes to redeeming the points, they fall flat. Be diligent in evaluating each point value and be sure you&#8217;re looking past the number of points in favor of what the points will actually get you. What are other fees associated with the card, aside from the annual fee? Pay close attention to the card’s terms and conditions to determine if there are fees associated with foreign transactions, late payments, overlimits and more. What is the APR? If your business needs to carry a balance, looking for a card with low interest rates, or interest-free promotional periods, can save money. Always remember that APRs are determined based on your creditworthiness, so the lowest interest rate presented in the terms and conditions might not be what you’re granted upon approval. Do I need a personal guarantee? Establishing business credit can be difficult, and some cards will require a personal guarantee. This means an individual, usually the one applying for the card on behalf of the company, will be held liable for any balances left unpaid on the card. For individuals who don’t want to be tied to their business account, there are cards available that don’t require a personal guarantee, such as the Brex Visa Commercial Credit Card .

Frequently Asked Questions How do I check my business credit score? You can access a free copy of your business credit score from Dun &amp; Bradstreet’s CreditSignal program, which provides access to some of your scores through a 14 day free trial or through Nav’s business credit reports which will give you a summary of your business scores from the three main business credit reporting agencies: Experian, Dun &amp; Bradstreet and Equifax. For full access to your business scores, you’ll have to pay for it. Experian, Dun &amp; Bradstreet and Equifax all offer several different types of paid access to your business credit history from a basic score to comprehensive score improvement tips. Can I apply for a business credit card without a business? Even if you don’t have a business yet, whether it’s a full-fledged endeavor or a side hustle from your corporate job, it’s still possible to get approved for a business credit card. That’s because business cards typically rely on your personal credit score as one of the determining factors for approval. If your FICO score isn’t as good as your business idea, there’s a small handful of secured credit cards for businesses that can help you improve your credit while you build your brand. Be aware that with nearly all small business cards, just like with a personal credit card, you are personally liable for any debts accrued to the card. In other words, if your business fails, you’re still responsible for any debt left on the card. What is the best business credit card? Choosing the best business card for your particular circumstances will be based on a combination of your business spending patterns, your goals in owning a particular business card (such as if you want rewards or a 0% introductory APR offer) and your personal credit history. There’s no one best card that can satisfy everyone’s needs. What is a business credit score? Unlike your personal credit score, which is generally a three-digit-figure determined Experian, Equifax and TransUnion, business credit scores are calculated by Dun &amp; Bradstreet, Experian and Equifax on a scale of 1 to 100, with 100 being the best. How does a business credit score differ from a personal credit score? A business credit score differs from a personal credit score in both the scoring system used and their intended purpose. A business credit score is on a scale from 1 to 100, with 100 being the highest possible score. A personal credit score is a three-digit number, usually starting at 350 and going up to 850. Why your business credit score matters Just like having a strong personal credit score can qualify you for better rates on your loans, a good business score can also signal to lenders that you’re qualified for financing on purchases or other loans. For example, if you need to sign a lease on a bigger space for your business, add a new truck to your fleet or make a big purchase of supplies for your business, a potential lender will likely check your business credit score to determine your creditworthiness and what terms to grant you. Can you get a business credit card without a personal guarantee? In most cases, when you apply for a business credit card, your approval will be based on your personal credit score. It also means you’ll be personally liable for any debts accrued on the card even if they’re from your business and that business fails. There are a small handful of business credit cards that don’t require a personal guarantee, like the Brex Corporate Card for Startups or the Stripe Corporate Card, that are aimed at well-funded corporations and require a review of your company’s financials to be considered. For small to mid-sized businesses, you’ll have to agree to a personal guarantee in order to get a small business credit card. When You Apply For A Business Credit Card, Is Approval Based On Your Personal Credit Score? When you apply for a business credit card, your approval will be based on your personal credit score. It also means you’ll be personally liable for any debts accrued on the card even if they’re from your business and that business fails. The issuer will also take other factors into consideration, like your business income and credit history. Can I apply for a business credit card with an EIN (Employer Identification Number)? It’s possible to apply for a business credit card with an EIN but most small business credit card applications will also require your Social Security number. That’s because most small business cards require a personal guarantee as part of the cardmember agreement. In many cases, a corporate credit card will only require your company’s EIN because corporate cards are designed for bigger companies with lots of revenue. There are very few business cards that don’t require a personal guarantee. One notable exception is the Brex card, which is designed for well-funded startups with at least $100,000 in the bank.
