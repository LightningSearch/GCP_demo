Clinc
Wins
AI
Breakthrough
Award
for
Best
Natural
Language
Generation
Platform
Conversational
AI
technology
leader
Clinc
today
announced
its
virtual
assistant
platform
has
been
named
the
winner
of
the
AI
Breakthrough
“Best
Natural
Language
Generation
Platform”
award
in
the
third
annual
AI
Breakthrough
Awards
program.
AI
Breakthrough,
a
leading
market
intelligence
organization,
recognizes
the
best
companies,
technologies,
products
and
services
in
the
field
of
AI
today.
More
than
2,000
nominations
were
analyzed,
evaluated
and
scored
by
an
independent
panel
of
experts
representing
a
mix
of
technical,
business,
academic
and
marketing
expertise
within
the
AI
industry.
Judges
evaluated
submissions
in
each
category
based
on
innovation,
performance,
ease
of
use,
functionality,
value
and
impact.
“Clinc
was
built
on
the
idea
that
conversational
AI
technology
could
be
transformed
to
deliver
a
higher
quality,
more
natural
conversational
experience
for
customers—and
that
wouldn’t
be
possible
without
our
patented
technology
and
NLP
that
creates
the
best
possible
interactions,”
said
Lingjia
Tang,
Clinc
co-founder
and
CTO.
“This
recognition
validates
our
vision
for
conversational
AI
that
pushes
boundaries
and
empowers
enterprises
to
deliver
automated
digital
experiences
that
customers
love.”
Clinc
uses
AI
and
ML
to
create
‘human
in
the
room’
automated
conversational
experiences
for
the
world&#8217;s
leading
enterprises
through
sophisticated,
contextual,
top-down
natural
language
processing
(NLP),
trained
to
be
intuitive
in
nature
to
keep
up
with
the
natural
flow
of
conversation,
understanding
slang
and
context.
Clinc’s
underlying
AI
algorithms
understand
messy
and
unscripted
language,
allowing
for
corrections
to
backtrack
and
“heal”
mistakes
made
in
human
conversation
and
enabling
complex
conversational
flows—conversations
that
a
real
human
would
be
able
to
understand.
In
contrast
to
a
speech-to-text
word
matching
algorithm,
Clinc
analyzes
dozens
of
factors
from
the
user’s
input
including
wording,
sentiment,
intent,
tone
of
voice,
time
of
day,
location
and
relationships,
and
uses
those
factors
to
deliver
an
answer
that
represents
a
composite
of
knowledge
extracted
from
its
trained
brain.
