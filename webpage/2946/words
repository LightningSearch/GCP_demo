Note:
Forbes
may
earn
a
commission
on
sales
made
from
partner
links
on
this
page,
but
that
doesn't
affect
our
editors'
opinions
or
evaluations.
Private
student
loans
are
best
used
to
pay
college
costs
after
you’ve
borrowed
the
maximum
you
qualify
for
in
both
subsidized
and
unsubsidized
federal
student
loans.
Private
student
loans
come
from
banks,
credit
unions
and
online
lenders,
and
unlike
federal
student
loans
for
undergraduates,
they
require
a
credit
check.
That
means
most
undergrads
will
need
a
co-signer
in
order
to
qualify.
Private
student
loans
also
are
more
expensive
than
federal
loans—especially
now
that
federal
loan
rates
are
at
historic
lows—and
typically
don’t
offer
the
flexible
repayment
options
their
federal
counterparts
do.
That’s
why
there
is
no
five-star
lender
on
our
list
of
private
student
loans:
In
the
vast
majority
of
cases,
the
best
college
financing
option
is
a
federal
student
loan.

Why
We
Picked
It
Ascent
offers
both
co-signed
and
non-co-signed
student
loans,
which
gives
borrowers
without
co-signers
more
college
funding
options.
We
scored
the
company
based
on
its
co-signed
credit-based
student
loan
for
undergraduates.
Ascent
stands
out
for
its
range
of
payment
reduction
and
postponement
options,
rare
among
private
lenders.
Borrowers
can
choose
a
graduated
repayment
plan,
which
provides
a
lower
monthly
payment
to
start
that
increases
over
time.
That
can
be
useful
for
graduates
just
starting
out,
who
will
likely
make
more
money
as
they
move
up
in
their
careers.
Borrowers
also
can
pause
payments
if
they’re
experiencing
a
temporary
financial
hardship
for
one
to
three
months
at
a
time,
up
to
a
maximum
of
24
months
total.
(Taking
this
forbearance
means
you
will
repay
the
loan
over
a
longer
period,
though.)
Interest
continues
to
accrue
during
forbearance,
which
is
true
for
the
vast
majority
of
private
student
loans.
Ascent
also
offers
a
graduation
reward
of
1%
of
the
loan’s
original
principal
balance.
Check
the
conditions
you
must
satisfy
to
qualify.
Ascent
was
a
winner
of
Forbes
Advisor’s
best
private
student
loans
of
2020

Why
We
Picked
It
Rhode
Island
Student
Loan
Authority,
known
as
RISLA,
is
a
nonprofit
based
in
Rhode
Island
that
lends
to
students
across
the
country.
It
offers
two
different
loan
types
for
undergraduate
students,
which
each
come
with
their
own
fixed
interest
rates.
One
loan
requires
immediate
repayment,
and
one
lets
you
defer
payments
until
six
months
after
you
leave
school.
Everyone
who
qualifies
for
each
of
the
loan
types
gets
the
same
rate,
which
makes
it
easy
to
compare
RISLA
loans
with
others
you’ve
qualified
for.
For
borrowers
who
struggle
to
afford
their
loan
after
graduating,
RISLA
is
one
of
the
only
private
lenders
to
offer
an
income-based
repayment
plan,
which
limits
payments
to
15%
of
income
for
a
25-year
period.
RISLA
was
a
winner
of
Forbes

best

Why
We
Picked
It
While
Funding
U’s
rates
are
higher
than
other
private
lenders’,
the
company
is
unique
in
that
it
doesn’t
make
loans
based
on
credit
history
and
it
doesn’t
require
student
borrowers
to
use
a
co-signer.
Borrowers
qualify
for
a
loan
based
on
academic
and
work
background,
current
courses,
graduation
prospects
and
likely
future
earnings.
Also,
while
Funding
U’s
loan
limits
are
comparatively
low,
private
loans
should
be
used
sparingly,
so
ideally
borrowers
won’t
need
them
to
finance
larger
gaps
in
funding.

Tips
for
Comparing
Private
Student
Loans
As
you
prepare
to
get
a
private
student
loan
,
don’t
wait
for
your
school
to
decide
how
much
of
a
loan
you
can
handle;
do
the
due
diligence
yourself.
Experts
recommend
borrowing
no
more
than
what
you’ll
most
likely
earn
in
your
first
year
out
of
college.
This
can
protect
you
from
having
unmanageable
monthly
payments
after
you
leave
school.
Some
private
student
loan
lenders
don’t
cap
the
amount
of
money
you
can
borrow
each
year,
but
yours
may.
As
you
evaluate
which
loan
suits
you
best,
find
out
how
the
loan
will
be
disbursed
and
what
costs
it
will
cover.
When
picking
a
private
student
loan,
look
at
the
overall
cost
of
the
loan—including
its
interest
rate
and
fees—and
what
help
the
lender
offers
if
you
have
trouble
affording
your
payments.
Just
one
of
the
lenders
on
this
list
charges
origination
fees,
and
all
except
for
one
wait
until
at
least
120
days
of
nonpayment
before
putting
loans
into
default
status.
When
comparing
rates,
know
the
low
end
of
the
rate
ranges
will
only
be
available
to
those
with
good
or
excellent
credit
scores.
Also,
all
rates
listed
below
include
a
standard
0.25%
interest
rate
discount
for
using
automatic
payments.

Private
Student
Loan
FAQs
How
are
interest
rates
determined
for
private
student
loans?
Private
student
loans
usually
offer
variable
and
fixed
interest
rates
that
are
based
on
the
borrower’s
creditworthiness.
If
you
have
good
or
excellent
credit,
then
you’ll
be
eligible
for
a
lower
interest
rate.
But
if
you
have
poor
or
fair
credit,
prepare
for
an
interest
rate
on
the
higher
end
of
the
range.
&nbsp;
Variable
rates
rise
and
fall
according
to
the
index
they
follow.
For
example,
the
lender
may
use
the
prime
rate
as
its
benchmark.
What
is
‘co-signer
release?’
Most
traditional
college
students
don’t
have
a
long
credit
history,
so
they
turn
to
another
adult
to
co-sign
their
loan.
A
co-signer
is
an
individual
who
is
willing
to
use
their
good
or
excellent
credit
history
to
help
someone
get
a
loan
that
the
student
does
not
qualify
for
alone.
If
the
borrower
can’t
make
payments
on
the
loan,
the
lender
seeks
payment
from
the
co-signer.
If
the
borrower
defaults
on
the
loan,
it
negatively
affects
the
co-signer’s
credit.
&nbsp;
Some
private
loans
offer
to
release
the
co-signer
from
the
loan
after
the
borrower
makes
a
certain
number
of
payments
or
meets
other
requirements.
That
can
protect
the
co-signer
from
a
credit
hit
as
a
result
of
the
primary
borrower’s
payment
history.
Do
private
student
loans
allow
deferment
or
forbearance?
Federal
student
loans
allow
you
to
delay
your
loan
payments
while
you
are
attending
school.
Some
private
student
loans
offer
this,
too,
but
interest
still
will
accrue
on
these
loans.
(With
federal
student
loans,
interest
does
not
accrue
during
deferment
if
you
have
subsidized
federal
direct
loans,
which
are
available
to
undergraduates
with
financial
need.)
&nbsp;
There
are
lenders
that
offer
other
types
of
deferment
.
For
example,
some
allow
you
to
delay
your
payments
due
to
a
financial
hardship,
like
unemployment,
or
during
military
deployment.
&nbsp;
Be
mindful
of
the
amount
of
interest
you’ll
owe
and
any
fees
the
lender
may
charge
for
deferment.
You’ll
want
to
review
your
deferment
options
before
choosing
a
loan.
&nbsp;
Like
deferment,
forbearance
lets
you
suspend
payments
for
a
certain
period
of
time.
Private
lenders
may
use
“forbearance”
and
“deferment”
interchangeably.
During
forbearance
on
federal
loans,
interest
continues
to
accrue,
which
differentiates
it
from
deferment.
&nbsp;
Regardless
of
whether
the
suspended
payments
are
referred
to
as
deferment
or
forbearance,
on
a
private
loan,
the
unpaid
interest
gets
added
to
your
principal,
causing
your
monthly
payments
to
increase
once
repayment
begins
again.
&nbsp;
Editor’s
note
:
Under
the
CARES
Act,
which
was
passed
in
response
to
the
coronavirus
(COVID-19)
pandemic,
federal
student
loan
borrowers
do
not
have
to
make
payments
for
a
period
of
six
months,
from
March
13
through
Jan.
31,
2021.
Additionally,
federal
student
loan
interest
rates
are
set
at
0%
during
that
time.
Which
fees
should
I
look
out
for
when
choosing
a
private
student
loan?
Just
like
you
should
read
the
fine
print
on
a
credit
card,
you
should
understand
the
fees
you
might
incur
on
private
student
loans.
Some
lenders
will
add
your
fees
to
the
loan
principal.
When
you
apply
for
a
private
student
loan,
seek
out
answers
to
the
following
questions:
&nbsp;
Is
there
a
loan
application
fee?
Is
there
a
loan
origination
fee?
Which
types
of
fees
could
I
incur
for
making
a
late
payment?

do
I

Quote
of

Day

The
Forbes
Advisor
editorial
team
is
independent
and
objective.
To
help
support
our
reporting
work,
and
to
continue
our
ability
to
provide
this
content
for
free
to
our
readers,
we
receive
compensation
from
the
companies
that
advertise
on
the
Forbes
Advisor
site.
This
compensation
comes
from
two
main
sources.
First
,
we
provide
paid
placements
to
advertisers
to
present
their
offers.
The
compensation
we
receive
for
those
placements
affects
how
and
where
advertisers’
offers
appear
on
the
site.
This
site
does
not
include
all
companies
or
products
available
within
the
market.
Second,
we
also
include
links
to
advertisers’
offers
in
some
of
our
articles;
these
“affiliate
links”
may
generate
income
for
our
site
when
you
click
on
them.
The
compensation
we
receive
from
advertisers
does
not
influence
the
recommendations
or
advice
our
editorial
team
provides
in
our
articles
or
otherwise
impact
any
of
the
editorial
content
on
Forbes
Advisor.
While
we
work
hard
to
provide
accurate
and
up
to
date
information
that
we
think
you
will
find
relevant,
Forbes
Advisor
does
not
and
cannot
guarantee
that
any
information
provided
is
complete
and
makes
no
representations
or
warranties
in
connection
thereto,
nor
to
the
accuracy
or
applicability
thereof.
Here
is
a
list
of
our
partners
who
offer
products
that
we
have
affiliate
links
for.
