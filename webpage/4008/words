If
you
are
a
fintech
startup,
then
few
things
are
more
important
than
access
to
financial
market
data.
And
for
those
companies
participating
in
the
FinTech
Sandbox,
an
&#8220;enabler
of
startups&#8221;
that
begins
March
26
in
Boston,
that
access
just
got
even
easier.
Cloud-based
financial
markets
data
provider
Xignite
will
join
 the 
FinTech
Sandbox&#8217;s
roster
of
data
partners.
This
roster
includes
three
other
companies
fintech
fans
will
be
familiar
with:
Finovate
alum
Yodlee
and
FinDEVr
alums
Tradier
and
Plaid
.
&#8220;Market
data
is
the
lifeblood
of
fintech,&#8221;
said
Xignite
CEO
Stephane
Dubois,
talking
about
his
company&#8217;s
participation
in
the
Sandbox.
&#8220;Without
full
access
to
these
data
points
in
the
early
stage
of
development
and
testing,
many
emerging
players
would
not
be
able
to
reach
their
full
potential
.&#8221;
FinTech
Sandbox
is
a
nonprofit
organization
based
in
Boston
that
is
dedicated
to
supporting
emerging
fintech
companies.
Participants
in
the
six-month
program
get
access
to
data
feeds
and
APIs
from
leading
data
providers,
cloud
hosting
from
the
program&#8217;s
infrastructure
partners,
beta
test
partners,
working
office
space,
and
&#8220;opportunities
to
collaborate
with
a
vibrant
community
of
entrepreneurs,
mentors,
partners,
investors,
and
service
providers.&#8221;
The
program
begins
March
26.
