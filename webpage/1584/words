The
field
of
data
science
seems
to
just
get
bigger
and
more
popular
everyday.
According
to
LinkedIn,
data
science
was
one
of
the
fastest-growing
job
fields
in
2017
and
in
2020
Glassdoor
ranked
the
job
of
data
science
as
one
of
the
three
best
jobs
within
the
United
States
.
Given
the
growing
popularity
of
data
science,
it’s
no
surprise
that
more
people
are
getting
interested
in
the
field.
Yet
what
is
data
science
exactly?
Let’s
get
acquainted
with
data
science,
taking
some
time
to
define
data
science,
explore
how
big
data
and
artificial
intelligence
is
changing
the
field,
learn
about
some
common
data
science
tools,
and
examine
some
examples
of
data
science.
What
is
Data
Science?
Before
we
can
explore
any
data
science
tools
or
examples,
we’ll
want
to
get
a
concise
definition
of
data
science
.
Defining
“data
science”
is
actually
a
little
tricky,
because
the
term
is
applied
to
many
different
tasks
and
methods
of
inquiry
and
analysis.
We
can
begin
by
reminding
ourselves
of
what
the
term
“science”
means.
Science
is
the
systematic
study
of
the
physical
and
natural
world
through
observation
and
experimentation,
aiming
to
advance
human
understanding
of
natural
processes.
The
important
words
in
that
definition
are
“observation”
and
“understanding”.
If
data
science
is
the
process
of
understanding
the
world
from
patterns
in
data,
then
the
responsibility
of
a
data
scientist
is
to
transform
data,
analyze
data,
and
extract
patterns
from
data.
In
other
words,
a
data
scientist
is
provided
with
data
and
they
use
a
number
of
different
tools
and
techniques
to
preprocess
the
data
(get
it
ready
for
analysis)
and
then
analyze
the
data
for
meaningful
patterns.
The
role
of
a
data
scientist
is
similar
to
the
role
of
a
traditional
scientist.
Both
are
concerned
with
the
analysis
of
data
to
support
or
reject
hypotheses
about
how
the
world
operates,
trying
to
make
sense
of
patterns
in
the
data
to
improve
our
understanding
of
the
world.
Data
scientists
make
use
of
the
same
scientific
methods
that
a
traditional
scientist
does.
A
data
scientist
starts
by
gathering
observations
about
some
phenomena
they
would
like
to
study.
They
then
formulate
a
hypothesis
about
the
phenomenon
in
question
and
try
to
find
data
that
nullifies
their
hypothesis
in
some
way.
If
the
hypothesis
isn’t
contradicted
by
the
data,
they
might
be
able
to
construct
a
theory,
or
model,
about
how
the
phenomenon
works,
which
they
can
go
on
to
test
again
and
again
by
seeing
if
it
holds
true
for
other
similar
datasets.
If
a
model
is
sufficiently
robust,
if
it
explains
patterns
well
and
isn’t
nullified
during
other
tests,
it
can
even
be
used
to
predict
future
occurrences
of
that
phenomenon.
A
data
scientist
typically
won’t
gather
their
own
data
through
an
experiment.
They
usually
won’t
design
experiments
with
controls
and
double-blind
trials
to
discover
confounding
variables
that
might
interfere
with
a
hypothesis.
Most
data
analyzed
by
a
data
scientist
will
be
data
gained
through
observational
studies
and
systems,
which
is
a
way
in
which
the
job
of
a
data
scientist
might
differ
from
the
job
of
a
traditional
scientist,
who
tends
to
perform
more
experiments.
That
said,
a
data
scientist
might
be
called
on
to
do
a
form
of
experimentation
called
A/B
testing
where
tweaks
are
made
to
a
system
that
gathers
data
to
see
how
the
data
patterns
change.
Regardless
of
the
techniques
and
tools
used,
data
science
ultimately
aims
to
improve
our
understanding
of
the
world
by
making
sense
out
of
data,
and
data
is
gained
through
observation
and
experimentation. 
Data
science
is
the
process
of
using
algorithms,
statistical
principles,
and
various
tools
and
machines
to
draw
insights
out
of
data,
insights
that
help
us
understand
patterns
in
the
world
around
us.
What
Do
Data
Scientists
Do?
You
might
be
seeing
that
any
activity
that
involves
the
analysis
of
data
in
a
scientific
manner
can
be
called
data
science,
which
is
part
of
what
makes
defining
data
science
so
hard.
To
make
it
more
clear,
let’s
explore
some
of
the
activities
that
a
data
scientist
might
do
on
a
daily
basis.
Data
science
brings
many
different
disciplines
and
specialties
together.

On
any
given
day,
a
data
scientist
might
be
asked
to:
create
data
storage
and
retrieval
schema,
create
data
ETL
(extract,
transform,
load)
pipelines
and
clean
up
data,
employ
statistical
methods,
craft
data
visualizations
and
dashboards,
implement
artificial
intelligence
and
machine
learning
algorithms,
make
recommendations
for
actions
based
on
the
data.
Let’s
break
the
tasks
listed
above
down
a
little.
A
data
scientist
may
be
required
to
handle
the
installation
of
technologies
needed
to
store
and
retrieve
data,
paying
attention
to
both
hardware
and
software.
The
person
responsible
for
this
position
may
also
be
referred
to
as
“
Data
Engineer
”.
However,
some
companies
include
these
responsibilities
under
the
role
of
data
scientists.
A
data
scientist
may
also
need
to
create,
or
assist
in
the
creation
of,
ETL
pipelines
.
Data
very
rarely
comes
formatted
just
as
a
data
scientist
needs.
Instead,
the
data
will
need
to
be
received
in
a
raw
form
from
the
data
source,
transformed
into
a
usable
format,
and
preprocessed
(things
like
standardizing
the
data,
dropping
redundancies,
and
removing
corrupted
data).
Statistical
Methods
of
Data
Science
The
application
of
statistics
is
necessary
to
turn
simply
looking
at
data
and
interpreting
it
into
an
actual
science.
Statistical
methods
are
used
to
extract
relevant
patterns
from
datasets,
and
a
data
scientist
needs
to
be
well
versed
in
statistical
concepts.
They
need
to
be
able
to
discern
meaningful
correlations
from
spurious
correlations
by
controlling
for
confounding
variables.
They
also
need
to
know
the
right
tools
to
use
to
determine
which
features
in
the
dataset
are
important
to
their
model/have
predictive
power.
A
data
scientist
needs
to
know
when
to
use
a
regression
approach
vs.
a
classification
approach,
and
when
to
care
about
the
mean
of
a
sample
vs.
the
median
of
a
sample.
A
data
scientist
just
wouldn’t
be
a
scientist
without
these
crucial
skills.
Data
Visualization
A
crucial
part
of
a
data
scientist’s
job
is
communicating
their
findings
to
others.
If
a
data
scientist
can’t
effectively
communicate
their
findings
to
others,
than
the
implications
of
their
findings
don’t
matter.
A
data
scientist
should
be
an
effective
story-teller
as
well.
This
means
producing
visualizations
that
communicate
relevant
points
about
the
dataset
and
the
patterns
discovered
within
it.
There
is
a
large
number
of
different
data
visualization
tools
that
a
data
scientist
might
use,
and
they
may
visualize
data
for
the
purposes
of
initial,
basic
exploration
(exploratory
data
analysis)
or
visualize
the
results
that
a
model
produces.
Recommendations
and
Business
Applications
A
data
scientist
needs
to
have
some
intuition
of
the
requirements
and
goals
of
their
organization
or
business.
A
data
scientist
needs
to
understand
these
things
because
they
need
to
know
what
types
of
variables
and
features
they
should
be
analyzing,
exploring
patterns
that
will
help
their
organization
achieve
its
goals.
The
data
scientists
need
to
be
aware
of
the
constraints
that
they
are
operating
under
and
the
assumptions
that
the
organization’s
leadership
are
making.
Machine
Learning
and
AI
Machine
learning
and
other
artificial
intelligence
algorithms
and
models
are
tools
used
by
data
scientists
to
analyze
data,
identify
patterns
within
data,
discern
relationships
between
variables,
and
make
predictions
about
future
events.
Traditional
Data
Science
vs.
Big
Data
Science
As
data
collection
methods
have
gotten
more
sophisticated
and
databases
larger,
a
difference
has
arisen
between
traditional
data
science
and
“big
data”
science.
Traditional
data
analytics
and
data
science
is
done
with
descriptive
and
exploratory
analytics,
aiming
to
find
patterns
and
analyze
the
performance
results
of
projects.
Traditional
data
analytics
methods
often
focus
on
just
past
data
and
current
data.
Data
analysts
often
deal
with
data
that
has
already
been
cleaned
and
standardized,
while
data
scientists
often
deal
with
complex
and
dirty
data.
More
advanced
data
analytics
and
data
science
techniques
might
be
used
to
predict
future
behavior,
although
this
is
more
often
done
with
big
data,
as
predictive
models
often
need
large
amounts
of
data
to
be
reliably
constructed.
“Big
data”
refers
to
data
that
is
too
large
and
complex
to
be
handled
with
traditional
data
analytics
and
science
techniques
and
tools.
Big
data
is
often
collected
through
online
platforms
and
advanced
data
transformation
tools
are
used
to
make
the
large
volumes
of
data
ready
for
inspection
by
data
science.
As
more
data
is
collected
all
the
time,
more
of
a
data
scientists
job
involves
the
analysis
of
big
data.
Data
Science
Tools
Common
data
science
tools
include
tools
to
store
data,
carry
out
exploratory
data
analysis,
model
data,
carry
out
ETL,
and
visualize
data.
Platforms
like
Amazon
Web
Services,
Microsoft
Azure,
and
Google
Cloud
all
offer
tools
to
help
data
scientists
store,
transform,
analyze,
and
model
data.
There
are
also
standalone
data
science
tools
like
Airflow
(data
infrastructure)
and
Tableau
(data
visualization
and
analytics).
In
terms
of
machine
learning
and
artificial
intelligence
algorithms
used
to
model
data,
they
are
often
provided
through
data
science
modules
and
platforms
like
TensorFlow,
PyTorch,
and
the
Azure
Machine-learning
studio.
These
platforms
like
data
scientists
make
edits
to
their
datasets,
compose
machine
learning
architectures,
and
train
machine
learning
models.
Other
common
data
science
tools
and
libraries
include
SAS
(for
statistical
modeling),
Apache
Spark
(for
the
analysis
of
streaming
data),
D3.js
(for
interactive
visualizations
in
the
browser),
and
Jupyter
(for
interactive,
sharable
code
blocks
and
visualizations).

Examples
of
Data
Science
Examples
of
data
science
and
its
applications
are
everywhere.
Data
science
has
applications
in
everything
from
food
delivery,
sports,
traffic,
and
health.
Data
is
everywhere
and
so
data
science
can
be
applied
to
everything.
In
terms
of
food,
Uber
is
investing
in
an
expansion
to
its
ride-sharing
system
focused
on
the
delivery
of
food,
Uber
Eats
.
Uber
Eats
needs
to
get
people
their
food
in
a
timely
fashion,
while
it
is
still
hot
and
fresh.
In
order
for
this
to
occur,
data
scientists
for
the
company
need
to
use
statistical
modeling
that
takes
into
account
aspects
like
distance
from
restaurants
to
delivery
points,
holiday
rushes,
cooking
time,
and
even
weather
conditions,
all
considered
with
the
goal
of
optimizing
delivery
times.
Sports
statistics
are
used
by
team
managers
to
determine
who
the
best
players
are
and
form
strong,
reliable
teams
that
will
win
games.
One
notable
example
is
the
data
science
documented
by
Michael
Lewis
in
the
book
Moneyball
,
where
the
general
manager
of
the
Oakland
Athletics
team
analyzed
a
variety
of
statistics
to
identify
quality
players
that
could
be
signed
to
the
team
at
relatively
low
cost.
The
analysis
of
traffic
patterns
is
critical
for
the
creation
of
self-driving
vehicles.
Self-driving
vehicles
must
be
able
to
predict
the
activity
around
them
and
respond
to
changes
in
road
conditions,
like
the
increased
stopping
distance
required
when
it
is
raining,
as
well
as
the
presence
of
more
cars
on
the
road
during
rush
hour.
Beyond
self-driving
vehicles,
apps
like
Google
Maps
analyze
traffic
patterns
to
tell
commuters
how
long
it
will
take
them
to
get
to
their
destination
using
various
routes
and
forms
of
transportation.
In
terms
of
health
data
science
,
computer
vision
is
often
combined
with
