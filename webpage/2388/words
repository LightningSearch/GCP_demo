Best
Practices
For
Marketing
To
Gen-Z
There's
never
been
a
generation
quite
like
the
members
of
Gen-Z.
Here's
what
marketers
need
to
know
about
connecting
with
them.

How
Long
Should
A
Brand
Name
Be?
Conventional
wisdom
is
that
a
brand
name
should
be
short
and
easy
to
say.
But,
some
brands
achieve
success
by
breaking
those
rules.

Roger

How
Much
Reach
Do
Marketers
Think
They
Get
In
Programmatic?
These
same
marketers
bought
into
the
concept
of
“the
long
tail”
which
suggested
that
ads
could
be
shown
to
humans
on
large
numbers
of
small
websites.
But
did
they
even
look
at
their
own
campaign
placement
reports?

In
A
Post-Covid
World
Customers
Will
Be
Revenge
Shopping
As
the
name
implies,
revenge
shopping
is
consumers
making
up
for
lost
time
with
an
increase
in
spending.
And
many
companies
are
using
it
as
a
lifeline
to
boost
sales
and
keep
their
businesses
afloat.
