E
veryone
knows
Donald
Trump
is
rich.
But
how
about
the
25
people
jockeying
to
replace
him
as
president?
Forbes
dug
into
the
details—examining
financial
disclosure
statements,
scouring
local
real
estate
records
and
calculating
pension
benefits—to
figure
out
the
finances
of
the
2020
candidates.
There
were
some
surprises.
Bernie
is
a
millionaire.
So
is
“middle-class
Joe”
Biden.
Elizabeth
Warren
is
richer
than
both
of
them,
worth
an
estimated
$12
million.
But
she’s
a
long
way
from
John
Delaney,
whose
$200
million
fortune
makes
him
twice
as
wealthy
as
every
other
Democratic
candidate
not
named
Tom
Steyer
or
Michael
Bloomberg.
<fbs-ad

progressive
ad-id="article-0-top">
Aside
from
Trump,
Steyer
and
Bloomberg,
the
average
net
worth
is
$12.9
million—the
same
as
it
was
for
the
2016
contenders.
The
median
net
worth
is
$2
million.
The
poorest
is
Pete
Buttigieg,
who
has
an
estimated
$100,000—or
about
0.003%
of
Trump’s
fortune.
We
reached
out
to
the
candidates.
No
one,
not
even
the
Democrats
who
spend
the
most
time
bashing
Trump
for
his
financial
dealings,
answered
every
question.
So
we
ranked
the
entire
field
on
transparency
,
assigning
scores
ranging
from
0
(lips
sealed)
to
5
(full
disclosure).
In
the
end,
we
uncovered
the
money,
regardless
of
whether
the
candidates
wanted
it
out
in
the
open.

In
November,
former
New

City
mayor
Michael
Bloomberg
joined
a
dozen
other
Democrats
aiming
to
unseat
Donald
Trump.
He
has
the

to
an
88%

in
financial
information
company
Bloomberg
LP,
which
generates
an

$10
billion
in
annual
revenue
and
throws
off
piles
of
cash.
Bloomberg
used
$250
million
of
his
own

running
for

three
times,
and
he

The
billionaire-in-chief
is
rich
enough
to
fund
his
entire
presidential
campaign
by
himself.
Not
that
he
will.
While
donors
around
the
country
have
been
pitching
in
to
support
his
reelection
effort,
the
richest
president
in
American
history
has

filings.

raised
:
$50

After
years
of
backing
other
Democrats,
the
hedge
funder
is
trying
his
own
luck
as
a
candidate.
Money
won’t
be
an
issue.
Steyer
founded
Farallon
Capital
in
1986
and
turned
it
into
one
of
the
largest
hedge
fund
firms
in
the
country.
He
stepped
back
in
2012
to
focus
on
politics
and
philanthropy,
concentrating
his
early
efforts
on
protecting
the
environment.
That
struck
some
people
as
odd,
given
that
he
had
previously
invested
in
the
fossil-fuel
industry.
Oil
tycoon
Harold
Hamm
,
a
prominent
Trump
supporter,
once
called
Steyer
“the
world’s
biggest
hypocrite.”
For
his
part,
Steyer
said
he
had
a
change
of
heart
and
divested
his
old
fossil-fuel
holdings.

Mayor
Bill

has
spent
most
of
his
life
in
public

but
like
the
Oval
Office
occupant

he

his
fortune
to
timely
investments
in
New

City
real

In

de
Blasio,
who
held
a

of
city

federal
jobs
before
being
elected
mayor,
and
his
wife
bought
a
1,200-square-foot

on
a
quiet
Brooklyn
block.
Four
years
later,
they

up

road.
Since
then,
real

Last

Methodology
:
By
law,
all
presidential
candidates
must
file
financial
disclosure
reports,
which
list
most
of
their
assets
and
liabilities
in
broad
ranges.
That
gives
us
a
start.
We
narrow
those
ranges
wherever
possible,
then
hunt
for
holdings
and
debts
not
listed
on
the
filings,
like
personal
real
estate,
mortgages
and
federal
government
pensions.
This
ranking
includes
assets
owned
by
spouses
and
dependent
children.
