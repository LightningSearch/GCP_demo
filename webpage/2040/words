Chris
Nicholson
is the
founder
of
Pathmind
,
an
AI
startup
that
applies
deep
reinforcement
learning
 to
supply
chain
and
industrial
operations.
Pathmind
was founded
to
help businesses
handle
deep
economic
change
and
increase
the
resilience
of
their operations
with
AI.
Chris
oversees
the
company’s
strategic vision
and day-to-day
execution,
driving
innovation
and
growth
for
Pathmind’s
technology platform,
and
optimizing
performance
in
warehouses
and
on factory
floors
as part
of
the
digital
transformation
of
business.
Previously,
Chris
was
the
CEO
of
Skymind,
an
AI
company
focused
on
deep learning.
Before
that,
he
held
communications
and
recruiting
roles
for FutureAdvisor,
a
Sequoia-backed
Y
Combinator
startup
that
was
acquired
by BlackRock
in
2015
for
$200
million.
Chris
also
spent
a
decade
as
a
journalist, reporting
on
technology
and
finance
for
The
New
York
Times,
Bloomberg
News
and Businessweek,
among
others.
You
were
previously
a
correspondent
for
The
New
York
Times
and
an
editor
for
Bloomberg
News
before
pivoting
to
machine
learning
,
could
you
discuss
the
journey
behind
this
realignment
of
your
career
path?
When
I
was
a journalist,
in
the
2000s
and
early
2010s,
the
industry
was
suffering
as
ads moved
to
search
engines
and
social
media,
and
traditional
publications
lost readers.
I
was
covering
finance
and
tech
and
I
saw
people
building
a
lot
of
new and
interesting
things.
At
a
certain
point,
I
told
myself
I
needed
to
get
on the
right side
of
the
robots,
so
I
moved
to
San
Francisco.
That
was 2013.
There
were
still
hacker
houses
in
SOMA
then.
I
moved
into
one
of
those, onto
a
bunk
in
a
room
with
five
other
guys,
and
went
to
work
each
and every morning
at
a
startup
that
had
gone
through
Y
Combinator.
Working
in
San
Francisco, I
slowly
got
to
know
people
and
figure
out
what
I
was
interested
in.
Back then, 
deep
learning
was
still
taking
off.
You
could
see
the
potential,
but
there
was still
a
lot
to
build.
This
curiosity
drove
me
to
get
involved
in
an
AI
project that eventually
led
to
Pathmind.
Could
you
share
some
details
on
how
Pathmind
can
assist businesses?
Businesses that
have
a
physical
plant
to
manage,
such
as
a
warehouse,
a
factory
or
a mining
site,
usually
confront
really
complex
optimization
tasks.
That
is,
they need
to
coordinate
a
lot
of
equipment
to
meet
a
goal.
Many
of
them
are
trying to
maximize
throughput
and
efficiency,
and
minimize
costs
and
carbon
emissions. We design
algorithms
that
can
use
their
real
data
to
show
new
ways
for
them
to make
their
equipment
behave.
That
can
apply
to
job
and
machine
scheduling, fleet routing
and
energy
cost
management,
among
other
things.
What
are
some
benefits
of
open
source
software
for
machine learning
systems?
Software companies
are
all
boats
floating
on
a
sea
of
open-source
code.
The infrastructure
of
the
public
clouds
runs
on
open
source.
A
lot
of
the
tools that developers
use
to
build
web
sites
and
machine
learning
applications
is also
open
source.
It’s
a
vibrant
ecosystem.
We
are
early
adopters
working
for exciting
new open
source
projects
such
as
Ray,
which
helps
you
spin
up distributed
computing
for
AI
workloads.
You
are
clearly
bullish
on
the
future
of
deep
reinforcement learning,
in
your
opinion
what
types
of
businesses
are
best
positioned
to
take advantage of
this
type
of
machine
learning?
The
companies we
work
typically
have
data
they’re
using
to
track
their
operations
and performance.
They
tend
to
have
physical
operations
where
they
can
control the behavior
of
the
equipment.
Our
algorithms
need
data
to
understand
the environment
in
which
they
operate,
and
they
need
to
be
presented
with
actions to choose
from,
like
equipment
to
control,
so
that
they
can
have
an
effect
on the
outcomes.
Essentially,
businesses
that
have
physical
operations
to
control, have
data about
those
operations,
and
some
analytics
in
place
for
that
data, are
in
a
good
position
to
start
thinking
about
optimization
like
ours.
Is
there
anything
else
that
you
would
like
to
discuss
about Pathmind?
One
thing
we do
that
is
adjacent
to
controlling
physical
operations
is
to
help
businesses predict
time
series.
So,
data
such
as
prices
or
demand
will
influence
how
a company
behaves,
and
how
much
it
produces.
To
produce
the
right
amount,
they need
to
know
how
much
demand
there
will
be.
And,
to
be
able
to
correctly
set their
prices,
they
have
to
have
a
read
on
price
fluctuations.
Our
algorithms are
able
to
make
those
forecasts.
