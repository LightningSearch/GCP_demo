Yi
Zou
manages
the
data
science
product
engineering
teams
at
ASML
Silicon
Valley
.
ASML
develops
sophisticated
software
and
metrology
solutions,
addressing
escalating
complexities
encountered
at
smaller
nodes.
What
was
it
that
interested
you
to
pursue
engineering?
As
a
child,
I
was
always
very
inquisitive
and
interested
in
understanding
how
things
work.
This
led
me
to
gravitate
to
subjects
like
science
in
high
school,
but
quickly
realized
engineers
were
the
people
who
designed
and
built
solutions
to
address
real
problems
and
make
a
positive
impact
to
our
world.
In
college,
I
also
appreciated
how
engineering
degrees
focused
on
developing
other
important
skills,
beyond
the
fundamentals
of
physics
and
mathematics,
that
are
highly
transferrable
in
the
job
market
to
many
different
careers.
Engineers
acquire
strong
analytical
thinking
and
critical
problem
solving
skills,
as
well
as
the
ability
to
transition
between
big
picture
thinking
to
a
detail-oriented
approach
needed
to
bring
ideas
to
life
–
from
creative
concept
to
system
design
to
end
product.
&nbsp;
Can
you
share
with
us
your
journey
of
how
you
became
the
Sr.
Director
of
Engineering
at
ASML?
In
2014,
I
joined
ASML
from
GlobalFoundries,
an
American
semiconductor
company
who
design
and
fabricate
silicon
chips.
As
a
member
of
the
Advanced
Technology
Development
team
at
ASML
Silicon
Valley,
I
led
several
research
projects
focused
on
evaluating
and
prototyping
lithography
techniques
used
to
improve
the
manufacturing
process
of
chips,
such
as
improved
pattern
resolution.
Over
the
same
time
period,
I
built
a
technical
team
that
specialized
in
machine
learning
.
We
demonstrated
the
feasibility
of
applying
deep
learning
to
several
critical
applications,
which
led
to
the
development
of
a
new
product
family.
I
also
led
close
collaboration
with
a
leading
chipmaking
company
to
explore
data
science
applications
within
high-volume
manufacturing
fabs
(factories
where
chips
are
made).
This
led
to
the
creation
of
several
new
added-value
opportunities
for
ASML.
Since
my
latest
promotion
in
2019,
I’m
continuing
to
expand
data
science
techniques
to
our
broader
customer
market.
&nbsp;
ASML
is
an
innovation
leader
in
the
semiconductor
industry,
as
they
provide
chipmakers
with
everything
they
need
–
hardware,
software
and
services
–
to
mass
produce
patterns
on
silicon
through
lithography.
Can
you
quickly
summarize
what
lithography
is
in
reference
to
designing
computer
chips
?
The
work
that
ASML
does
is
a
key
ingredient
to
making
chips
more
powerful,
cheaper,
more
energy-efficient
and
more
ubiquitous.
It
starts
with
our
lithography
system,
which
essentially
is
a
projection
system,
that
uses
ultraviolet
light
to
create
billions
of
tiny
structures
on
thin
slices
of
silicon.
Light
is
projected
onto
a
blueprint
of
the
pattern
(known
as
a
‘reticle’
or
‘mask’)
that
will
be
printed.
Optics
focus
the
pattern
onto
the
silicon
wafer,
which
has
earlier
been
coated
with
a
light-sensitive
chemical.
When
the
unexposed
parts
are
etched
away,
a
three-dimensional
pattern
is
revealed.
The
process
is
repeated
time
and
again
in
that
step-and-scan
system,
which
measure
and
expose
in
parallel.
Those
chips
form
what
amounts
to
a
multi-story
“city”
of
circuits
with
billions
of
tiny
connections
on
wafer-thin
layers.
Together,
these
structures
make
up
an
integrated
circuit,
or
chip.
The
more
structures
that
chipmakers
can
cram
on
a
chip,
the
faster
and
more
powerful
it
is.
&nbsp;
ASML
has
two
main
types
of
lithography
systems.
To
begin
could
you
explain
what
the
EUV
lithography
system
is?
EUV
represents
the
biggest
step
in
lithography
advancement
since
the
beginning.
The
tricky
thing
with
EUV
light
is
that
it’s
absorbed
by
everything,
even
air.
It
is
also
notoriously
hard
to
generate.
An
EUV
lithography
system
has
a
large
high-vacuum
chamber
in
which
the
light
can
travel
far
enough
to
land
on
the
wafer.
The
light
is
guided
by
a
series
of
ultra-reflective
mirrors.
An
EUV
system
uses
a
high-energy
laser
that
fires
on
a
microscopic
droplet
of
molten
tin
(that’s
travelling
50,000
times
per
second)
and
turns
it
into
plasma,
emitting
EUV
light,
which
then
is
focused
into
a
beam.
&nbsp;
Can
you
explain
how
the
DUV
lithography
system
differs
from
the
EUV
lithography
system?
Our
DUV
lithography
system
is
the
industry’s
workhorse
that
are
used
to
manufacture
a
broad
range
of
semiconductor
nodes
and
technologies.
EUV
is
used
alongside
DUV
systems
at
the
most
advanced
nodes
and
critical
layers
to
drive
affordable
scaling.
&nbsp;
One
of
the
really
impressive
aspects
of
ASML,
is
how
the
company
refurbishes
old
systems
such
as
the
‘classic’
PAS
5500
and
TWINSCAN
lithography
systems.
What
are
they
currently
being
refurbished
for?
Both
Moore’s
Law
and
More
than
Moore
fuel
demand
for
our
cost-effective
solutions,
driving
sales
of
both
newly
build
TWINSCAN
immersion
and
dry
systems,
as
well
as
refurbished
PAS
5500
and
TWINSCAN
steppers
and
scanners.
&nbsp;
What’s
the
current
nanometer
wavelength
ASML
can
work
with?
ASML’s
most
advanced
EUV
lithography
systems
delivers
13.5
nm
wavelength
of
EUV
light.
&nbsp;
Moore’s
Law
has
been
consistent
for
multiple
decades
now,
do
you
believe
that
Moore’s
Law
is
near
its
end
or
that
it
can
be
further
stretched
out?
Extending
Moore’s
Law
is
becoming
increasingly
difficult
and
costly,
but
it
is
not
dead.
We
aren’t
as
close
to
the
fundamental
limits
of
physics
as
some
would
have
us
believe.
Next-generation
chip
designs
will
include
more
exotic
materials,
new
packaging
technologies
and
more
complex
3D
designs.
These
new
designs
will
enable
the
next
big
waves
of
innovation,
like
advanced
artificial
intelligence
and
fast
connectivity
with
5G,
as
well
as
generate
consumer
products
we
haven’t
even
conceived
yet.
I
personally
work
within
ASML’s
Applications
business
focused
on
developing
software
solutions
to
extend
the
performance
capabilities
of
our
hardware,
which
is
used
by
chipmakers
to
mass
produce
ever-smaller
patterns
on
silicon.
It
would
be
impossible
for
our
lithography
systems
to
manufacture
chips
at
increasingly
small
dimensions
without
the
software
we
develop.
Our
team
of
engineers
is
constantly
working
to
understand
and
model
the
physical
effects
that
influence
the
patterning
process,
so
we
can
predict
how
a
design
pattern
will
be
printed
onto
a
silicon
wafer
and
optimize
its
shape
to
generate
the
image
we
want.
This
is
an
iterative,
computationally
intensive
process
that
requires
the
efficient
and
accurate
utilization
of
a
large
scale,
distributed
high-performance
computing
architecture.
Today’s
advanced
chips
have
billions
of
transistors,
meaning
we
must
simulate
and
optimize
the
imaging
of
billions
of
patterns.
In
order
to
achieve
this
with
extreme
accuracy
within
24
hours,
we
must
find
clever
ways
to
continue
improving
model
performance,
in
terms
of
accuracy
and
runtime.
As
these
chip
layouts
become
more
complex
to
extend
Moore’s
Law,
machine
learning
can
dramatically
speed
up
a
key
part
of
the
simulation
and
manufacturing
process.
Within
the
teams
at
ASML
Silicon
Valley,
data
scientists
are
researching
how
to
design
a
new
neural
network
to
help
understand
complex
physics
that
is
unknown
to
physical
model
and
then
use
the
neural
network
to
augment
physical
modeling
approach.
The
methodology
used
to
develop
rigorous
physical
models
and
machine
learning
models
are
very
similar.
Both
need
lots
of
experimental
results
and
data
to
shape
the
prediction,
but
machine
learning
saves
a
lot
of
time
and
effort,
while
improving
accuracy.
It
also
presents
an
opportunity
to
more
fully
utilize
the
large
amounts
of
data
generated
in
a
manufacturing
environment
to
enhance
process
control.
This
is
but
one
example
to
illustrate
the
broader
theme
across
our
industry:
As
long
as
there
are
technologists
tasked
with
the
mission
to
extend
Moore’s
Law,
new
innovative
solutions
will
address
the
scaling
problem
via
many
different
creative
avenues.
&nbsp;
Is
there
anything
else
that
you
would
like
to
share
about
ASML?
In
Silicon
Valley,
ASML
employs
a
highly
specialized
software
powerhouse
dedicated
to
extending
Moore’s
Law
by
tapping
into
its
unique
expertise
in
physical
modeling
and
numerical
algorithms.
This
positions
us
to
focus
on
several
key
imperatives
for
the
company,
including:
Leverage
ever-growing
computational
power
to
further
advance
our
machine
learning
applications
focused
on
simulating
the
lithography
process
to
extend
Moore’s
Law,
Integrate
our
computational
and
metrology
competencies
to
further
improve
model
accuracy,
as
well
as
generate
and
better
utilize
large
amount
of
high-quality
image
data
to
improve
patterning
optimization
technology,
and
Support
and
extend
our
computational
solutions
for
the
next-generation
EUV
lithography
roadmap
to
support
the
continuation
of
Moore’s
Law.
While
these
are
different
product
roadmaps,
each
parallel
path
is
crucial
to
further
maintaining
chipmaker’s
aggressive
scaling
efforts.
And
machine
learning
is
an
enabling
technology
used
in
each
path.
Our
innovations
don’t
only
drive
forward
an
entire
consumer
technology
industry,
but
also
drives
further
innovation
within
our
own
products
as
we
gain
ever-increasing
computational
power.
Thank
you
for
answering
all
of
our
questions.
