O
ne
of
David
Sandler’s
classic
selling
rules
sounds
like
a
bit
of
a
riddle
when
you
first
hear
it:
Don’t
buy
back
tomorrow
the
product
or
service
you
sold
today.
Why
would
you
ever
do
that?
Who
would
want
to?
And
under
what
circumstances
would
it
possibly
happen?
Buy
Back
Happens
All
Of
The
Time
The
truth
is
this
buy-back
happens
all
the
time.
But
we
can
prevent
it.
Sandler’s
rule
is
about
preventing
the
common
phenomenon
known
as
buyer’s
remorse.
And
if
we
don’t
take
the
right
steps
to
prevent
it,
we
really
are
buying
back
whatever
we
just
sold
to
the
prospect.
We’ve
all
run
into
situations
where
we
received
a
“yes”
from
the
buyer,
and
then
for
some
reason,
the
relationship
went
dark.
We
couldn’t
get
them
back
on
the
phone.
Or
they
decided
to
cancel
through
email.
Or
maybe
they
contacted
someone
else
in
the
organization
and
made
it
clear
that
they
did
not
want
to
buy,
even
though
they
wouldn’t
say
that
directly
to
us.
The
point
is,
we
could
never
get
face-to-face
or
voice-to-voice
with
them
to
use
all
our
selling
skills
to
figure
out
what
happened…
and
maybe
put
the
deal
back
together.
The
key
to
avoiding
that
painful
experience
is
to
acknowledge
that
every
time
somebody
says
“yes”
to
us
–
whether
we
are
face-to-face
or
voice-to-voice
–
that
“yes”
is
conditional.
No
matter
how
positive
the
signals
are
at
that
moment,
the
client
is
still
likely
to
experience
buyer’s
remorse
once
we
leave.
Our
job
as
a
sales
professional
is
to
walk
them
through
the
buyer’s
remorse
experience
in
front
of
us,
so
we
can
deal
with
it
in
person,
and
hopefully
keep
the
deal
from
falling
apart.
We
want
to
find
a
way
to
use
our
in-person
selling
skills
to
help
the
buyer
navigate
the
predictable,
emotionally
difficult
experience
of
doubt
that
often
follows
a
purchase
decision.
Come
Back
To
A
Minor
Objection
One
great
way
to
do
this
is
to
think
of
a
minor
objection
that
came
up
during
the
sales
cycle
and
bring
it
back
up
for
discussion.
This
kind
of
decision
may
run
counter
to
our
instinct
to
“close
the
deal,”
but
it
needs
to
be
part
of
our
sales
process.
Here’s
a
quick
example
of
what
it
might
sound
like.
“Mary,
I
know
you
wanted
the
product
in
blue;
we
only
have
red.
And
you
said
that
was
going
to
be
okay.
I
just
want
to
revisit,
before
we
conclude
our
discussion
today,
that
red
really
is
going
to
be
all
right
with
you.”
When
Mary
thinks
it
over
for
a
moment
and
then
says,
“Yes,
actually
red
is
fine,”
something
important
takes
place.
She
has
psychologically
closed
the
file.
She’s
good.
She’s
gone
through
the
process
of
setting
aside
doubt.
And
we
helped
her
to
do
that!
It’s
part
of
our
job
to
help
people
manage
the
fear,
doubt,
and
worry
they
have
about
making
the
right
decision,
so
we
need
to
play
the
role
of
the
psychiatrist
here.
We
need
to
help
them
process
their
natural
insecurity,
and
then
work
with
them
to
overcome
it.
Help
Buyers
Overcome
Buyer’s
Remorse
What
David
Sandler
was
suggesting
is
that
we
make
a
conscious
choice
to
help
buyers
overcome
those
fears,
doubts,
and
worries
while
they
are
still
in
front
of
us…
so
we
don’t
end
up
having
to
buy
back
the
product
or
service
that
we
sold
today.

questioning
techniques
that
will
help
you
close
the
sale.
