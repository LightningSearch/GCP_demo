Note:
Forbes

our
editors'
opinions
or
evaluations.
Credit
cards
are
known
for
charging
higher
interest
rates
than
many
other
financial
products,
but
some
cards
offer
a
0%
APR
period,
which
can
help
you
avoid
interest
for
anywhere
from
9
to
21
months.
This
can
help
you
reduce
interest
costs
on
long-term
debt
and
potentially
even
score
an
“interest-free
loan”
on
a
large
purchase
you
hope
to
make.
Some
0%
APR
cards
let
you
avoid
interest
payments
on
purchases
and
balance
transfers,
but
others
only
extend
their
offers
to
one
or
the
other.
0%
APR
cards
also
can
lack
features
compared
to
other
cards. 
If
a
balance
transfer
or
intro
APR
is
not
your
priority,
you&#8217;ll
be
better
served
by
considering
other
options.
Forbes
Advisor
created
this
guide
to
help
you
find
the
right
card
to
reach
your
financial
goals,
whether
they
include
debt
consolidation
or
financing
a
large
purchase
without
interest
charges.

Why

It
The
U.S.
Bank
Visa®
Platinum
Card
offers
a
very
lengthy
20-billing
cycle
0%
intro
APR
rate
and
no
annual
fee.
There
are
two
caveats,
which
are
the
3%
balance
transfer
fee
and
the
lack
of
a
rewards
program.
Still,
the
savings
on
interest
can
eclipse
the
3%
fee.
Pros
&
Cons
No

Very
long
0%

Cell

benefit.

It
The

a
mediocre
card
with

the

which
doubles
your
rewards
at
the
end
of

The
high

Why
We
Picked
It
The
Wells
Fargo
Visa
Signature®
Card
begins
as
an
excellent
value
but
falls
short
in
the
long
run.
While
the
5x
points
earned
during
the
first
six
months
can
be
worth
up
to
$1,000
in
travel,
the
ongoing
1x
points
rate
is
lackluster.
The
15-month
intro
APR
extends
the
honeymoon
period,
after
which
the
APR
can
range
from
low
to
very
high,
depending
on
your
credit.

The
Citi

aims
to
keep
its
0%

offer
easy.
The
card
charges
no
late

no
penalty

and
no
annual
fee.
It
also
doesn’t
earn
any

so
it’s
ideally

used
as
a
tool
in
your
debt
payoff
plan.

Benefits
and
Drawbacks:
The
Citi

comes
with
Citi
perks
including
the
ability
to
choose
your
own

date
and
the
ability
to
skip
endless

But
beyond
the
introductory
period,
there
isn’t
much
incentive
to
use
this
card
as
it
doesn’t
earn
rewards
or
offer
other
valuable
benefits.
How
to
Pick
a
0%
APR
Credit
Card
Look
for
the
longest
0%
APR
offer
available.
More
importantly,
make
sure
that
the
offer
you’re
considering
is
long
enough
so
you
can
pay
off
all
or
most
of
your
debt
without
any
interest
.
Check
for
fees.
If
you
believe
you
could
pay
off
all
your
debt
in
a
fairly
short
amount
of
time,
it’s
worth
it
to
consider
0%
APR
credit
cards
that
don’t
charge
a
balance
transfer
fee.
Consider
which
perks
you
want.
Ask
yourself
if
you’re
interested
in
any
other
credit
card
perks
you
can
qualify
for,
such
as
a
free
FICO
score
on
your
statement
each
month.
Consider
your
spending
style
.
If
your
goal
is
earning
rewards
on
your
purchases
while
avoiding
interest,
it
can
help
to
think
about
the
type
of
purchases
you
planned
to
make.
Some
cards
offer
more
rewards
in
specific
bonus
categories,
so
you
should
choose
a
card
that
will
give
you
the
most
bang
for
your
buck.
Look
at
the
ongoing
variable
APR.
While
balance
transfer
credit
cards
can
help
you
save
on
interest,
remember
that
your
card’s
APR
will
eventually
reset
to
the
regular
ongoing
APR.
Frequently
Asked
Questions
What
does
purchase
APR
mean?
Purchase
APR
(Annual
Percentage
Rate)
refers
to
the
amount
of
interest
you’ll
pay
on
something
you
bought
with
your
credit
card
if
you
carry
a
balance
from
month
to
month.
Your
card’s
APR
should
be
clearly
spelled
out
when
you’re
approved
for
your
card
and
also
can
be
found
on
your
monthly
statement
in
the
section
showing
how
your
interest
for
that
billing
cycle
was
calculated.
Most
credit
cards
calculate
interest
using
the
average
daily
balance
method,
which
means
your
interest
is
compounded
and
accumulates
every
day,
based
on
your
daily
rate
of
interest.
In
other
words,
every
day
your
finance
charges
are
based
on
the
balance
from
the
day
before.
The
daily
rate
of
interest
on
your
purchase
is
determined
by
dividing
your
card’s
APR
by
365
to
find
the
daily
rate
of
interest
and
then
multiplying
that
number
by
your
balance.
What
does
0
APR
mean?
A
0%
APR
offer
is
an
introductory
period
without
finance
charges
on
either
purchases,
balance
transfers
or
both.
Getting
a
break
from
finance
charges
can
be
a
welcome
change
from
the
double-digit
interest
typically
charged
on
credit
cards
or
other
loans.
The
less
you’re
paying
in
interest,
the
more
you
can
put
towards
paying
off
your
debt.
What
is
the
best
credit
card
with
no
interest?
There’s
no
one
best
credit
card
with
no
interest,
only
what’s
best
for
your
particular
circumstances.
When
choosing
a
credit
card
for
its
interest-free
offer,
if
you’re
seeking
the
best
no
interest
offer
on
purchases,
consider
the
length
of
time
of
the
offer. 
If
you’re
seeking
the
best
no
interest
offer
on
a
balance
transfer
card
,
consider
both
the
length
of
time
and
the
amount
it
will
cost
if
there’s
a
balance
transfer
fee.
You
should
also
look
beyond
the
interest-free
period
and
see
if
there’s
value
to
you
in
the
card
when
the
promotional
offer
expires.
What
is
an
intro
APR?
An
introductory
APR
is
a
promotional
offer
made
by
credit
card
companies
to
entice
potential
customers
to
sign
up
for
a
new
card.
An
intro
APR
is
typically
either
a
0%
or
ultra-low
APR
offer
that
applies
for
a
limited
period
of
time.
When
the
intro
offer
expires
the
card
will
revert
to
its
standard
APR,
which
is
within
a
range
specified
in
the
cardholder
agreement.
What
is
a
purchase
interest
charge?
A
purchase
interest
charge
is
the
amount
you’ll
pay
in
interest
for
anything
you
buy
on
your
credit
card.
For
example,
if
your
credit
card
has
an
APR
of
20%
and
you
buy
a
new
couch
for
$1,000,
over
the
course
of
a
year
if
you
didn’t
make
a
single
payment
towards
your
card,
you’d
tack
on
an
additional
$200
in
interest
charges. 
In
practice,
you
typically
accrue
interest
on
a
daily
accumulated
rate,
which
means
every
day
your
finance
charges
are
based
on
the
balance
from
the
day
before.
The
daily
rate
of
interest
on
your
purchase
is
determined
by
dividing
your
card’s
APR—in
this
example
20%—
by
365
to
find
the
daily
rate
of
interest
and
then
multiplying
that
number
by
your
balance.  
Since
this
method
is
compounding
your
interest
charges,
you’ll
end
up
paying
more
than
$200
in
additional
interest
over
the
course
of
a
year
if
you
made
zero
payments
towards
that
principal
amount
of
your
purchase.
