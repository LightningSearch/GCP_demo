Finding
the
best
life
insurance
company
can
mean
navigating
a
bewildering
range
of
product
features
and
pricing
variables.
A
life
insurance
purchase
is
often
a
long-term
commitment,
intended
to
provide
for
loved
ones
many
decades
down
the
road.
Cash
value
life
insurance,
in
particular,
can
require
a
significant
investment
of
money
and
a
long-range
strategy.
For
this
reason,
we’ve
ranked
life
insurance
companies
based
on
their
cash
value
products,
using
data
provided
to
Forbes
Advisor
by

We
put
emphasis
on
policy
costs
in
our
evaluation,
as
internal
costs
determine
your
level
of
cash
value
and
premiums.

Why
We
Picked
It
The
large
majority
(84%)
of
Pacific
Life’s
products
are
highly
cost
competitive.
Pacific
Life
was
named
the
#1
life
insurance
company
of
2020
by
Forbes
Advisor
.
What
We’re
Watching
Pacific
Life
is
currently
the
subject
of
a
lawsuit
regarding
the
reliability
of
policy
illustrations
for
some
of
its
newer
indexed
universal
life
insurance
policies.
Indexed
universal
life
insurance
is
tied
to
market
performance
and
can
be
particularly
difficult
for
consumers
to
understand
.
We’re
continuing
to
monitor
the
situation,
but
the
complexity
of
the
product
is
something
to
consider
if
you’re
buying
indexed
universal
life
insurance.
Pros
Lower
and
more
stable
internal
policy
costs
than
other
insurers
Superior
performance
of
investments
that
fuel
cash
value
gains
Cons
Some
of

products

costs

propel
it

Pros
Low
internal

Tips
for
Buying
Cash
Value
Life
Insurance
Cash
value
policies
are
good
for
buyers
whose
life
insurance
need
does
not
have
a
time
limit.
For
example,
cash
value
policies
can
be
used
for
estate
planning
purposes,
to
fund
a
trust
that
will
support
a
lifelong
dependent
such
as
a
special
needs
child,
to
accumulate
cash
value
for
investment
purposes,
or
to
simply
provide
a
legacy
for
heirs.
Permanent
life
insurance
policies
with
cash
value
include
whole
life
insurance
and
universal
life
insurance
.
Buyers
of
cash
value
life
insurance
policies
have
many
considerations
that
may
not
be
obvious
at
first.
While
many
life
insurance
shoppers
focus
on
the
annual
premiums
that
are
quoted,
factors
such
as
internal
policy
costs
and
a
company’s
investment
performance
can
greatly
affect
the
financial
benefits
of
the
policy
in
the
future.
Here
are
some
tips
for
buying
cash
value
policies,
based
on
the
factors
we
used
to
identify
the
best
life
insurance
companies.
Insist
that
cost
disclosures
be
included
in
any
proposals
for
universal
life
insurance.

insurance
quote
reflects
what
you’ll
be
billed
for,
but
doesn’t
tell
you
anything
about
a
policy’s
internal
costs,
such
as
expenses
and
fees,
and
the
cost
of
insurance
within
the
policy.
Be
sure
to
insist
that
any
universal
life
insurance
illustration
include
the
detailed
expense
pages
or
policy
accounting
pages.
It&#8217;s
important
to
look
at
the
year-by-year
policy
charges
instead
of
just
comparing
premiums.
Products
with
a
low
premium
quote
but
higher
costs
have
a
greater
risk
that
higher
premium
payments
will
be
required
in
the
future,
or
that
the
actual
growth
of
cash
value
will
be
low.
Look
at
financial
strength
ratings.
A
strong
financial
strength
rating
is
more
than
just
peace
of
mind
that
the
company
won’t
go
out
of
business
decades
from
now.
Insurers
with
greater
financial
strength
can
be
less
likely
to
need
to
increase
internal
policy
costs
and
premiums
in
response
to
challenging
financial
times.
Ratings
are
available
from
agencies
such
as
S&amp;P
and
A.M.
Best,
and
are
usually
found
on
insurers’
websites.
Don’t
assume
insurers
offer
competitive
pricing
for
everyone.
Insurers
want
your
business,
but
they
all
operate
from
their
own
playbooks.
Premiums
and
internals
costs
can
vary
wildly,
and
a
company
that
offers
competitive
costs
for
one
customer
may
not
have
a
good
deal
for
someone
else.
Each
life
insurance
product
can
have
more
than
10,000
different
prices
when
you
consider
that:
Each
product
has
different
pricing
at
every
age
Males
vs.
females
get
different
pricing
Pricing
varies
for
up
to
five
different
health
classes
There
can
be
two
or
three
price
variations
for
smoking
status
(smoker/non-smoker/never-smoked)
There
could
be
four
to
six
rate
bands
depending
on
how
much
coverage
you
buy
Rates
can
vary
if
you
want
a
product
that
accumulates
cash
value
faster
Be
aware
that
your
life
insurance
quote
may
not
reflect
what
you’ll
actually
end
up
paying
over
the
years
to
keep
the
policy.
“Current
regulations
in
some
states
and
for
some
products
permit
insurers
to
‘quote’
a
low
premium
while
charging
high
costs—without
disclosing
that
you
may
need
to
pay
additional
premiums
later
in
order
to
avoid
a
lapse,”
warns
Barry
Flagg,
founder
of
Veralytic.
That
means
it’s
essential
to
insist
that
proposals
include
year-by-year
disclosure
of
policy
charges
(for
universal
life
insurance)
or
the
dividend
interest
crediting
rate
(for
whole
life
insurance).

Methodology
We
rated
25
companies
large
life
insurance
companies
that
sell
cash
value
life
insurance.
Companies
that
sell
all
or
mostly
term
life
insurance
products
were
not
included,
nor
were
some
companies
that
are
direct
writers,
meaning
they
sell
policies
either
directly
to
consumers
or
only
through
their
own
exclusive
agents.
We
used
data
provided
to
Forbes
Advisor
by
Veralytic
,
a
leading
publisher
of
pricing
and
performance
research
and
competitiveness
ratings
for
cash
value
life
insurance
products.
Veralytic
maintains
a
database
of
thousands
of
life
insurance
products
and
measures
the
competitiveness
of
each
product
against
industry
benchmarks
to
score
each
policy.
Because
costs
are
usually
top
of
mind
for
life
insurance
buyers,
we
put
weight
on
costs
in
our
scoring.
Each
company
was
evaluated
based
on:
Cost
competitiveness
(40%
of
score)
of
premiums
and
internal
policy
charges,
including
the
cost
of
insurance,
fixed
administration
expenses
and
cash
value-based
wrap
fees.
Pricing
stability
(15%
of
score)
looks
at
whether
a
company’s
pricing
(the
cost
of
insurance,
policy
expenses
and
the
illustrated
earnings
rate
on
cash
value)
appear
to
be
adequate
and
reasonable,
based
on
the
insurer’s
historical
experience
with
pricing.
Access
to
cash
value
(15%
of
score)
evaluates
the
liquidity
of
cash
value
and
restrictions
on
accessing
the
policy
account.
Generally
speaking,
the
higher
the
liquidity,
particularly
in
early
policy
years,
the
better,
but
some
insurers
charge
more
for
greater
liquidity,
so
consider
if
there’s
a
tradeoff.
Historical
performance
(15%
of
score)
measures
whether
the
historical
performance
of
the
company’s
investments
that
underlie
policy
account
values
are
superior
to
similar
products.
Financial
strength
(15%
of
score)
incorporates
the
insurer’s
financial
strength
ratings
from
four
major
ratings
agencies.
Frequently
Asked
Questions
What
is
the
best
type
of
life
insurance
to
buy?
The
very
different
features
of
life
insurance
products
can
seem
confusing.
But
if
you’re
looking
for
life
insurance
protection
for
only
a
specific
number
of
years,
term
life
insurance
is
likely
the
best
fit.
Term
life
insurance
is
often
bought
by
people
who
want
life
insurance
to
cover
only
their
working
years,
or
the
years
of
a
mortgage.
&nbsp;
For
long-term
and
lifelong
needs,
permanent
life
insurance
products
such
as
whole
life
insurance
and
universal
life
offer
both
life
insurance
protection
and
cash
value.
What
kinds
of
death
are
not
covered
by
life
insurance?
Life
insurance
generally
covers
all
types
of
death,
whether
it’s
from
illness,
injury
or
old
age.
Even
homicide
and
death
by
drug
overdose
are
covered.
Suicide
is
usually
not
covered
within
the
first
two
years
after
the
policy
purchase,
but
is
covered
after
that
time
period.
&nbsp;
Accidental
death
and
dismemberment
insurance
has
a
life
insurance
payout
only
for
accidental
deaths,
such
as
a
car
crash
or
accidental
fall.
Can
I
buy
life
insurance
on
someone
else?
You
can
buy
life
insurance
on
someone
else,
such
as
a
spouse
or
a
parent,
as
long
as
you
have
an
“insurable
interest”
in
that
person.
That
means
you
would
suffer
financially
if
they
pass
away.
&nbsp;
If
you’re
the
policyowner
for
life
insurance
on
someone
else,
you
can
make
yourself
the
life
insurance
beneficiary
and
receive
the
payout.
&nbsp;
But
you
can’t
buy
life
insurance
on
someone
else
secretly—they’ll
need
to
sign
the
application.

The
Forbes

editorial
team
is

and
objective.
To

we
receive
compensation

sources.
First
,
we
provide
paid
placements
to
advertisers
to
present
their

The
compensation
we

This
site
does
not
include
all

or

the

Second,
we
also
include
links
to
advertisers’
offers
in
some
of
our
articles;
these
“affiliate

may
generate
income
for
our
site
when

click
on
them.
The
compensation
we
receive

advertisers
does
not

or
otherwise
