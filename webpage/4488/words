Clinc
,
a
four-year-old
AI
startup
based
in
Ann
Arbor,
Michigan,
today
announced
that
it’s
secured
$52
million
in
series
B
financing
led
by
Insight
Partners,
with
participation
from
DFJ
Growth
and
existing
investors
Drive
Capital
and
Hyde
Park
Venture
Partners.
The
mammoth
round
is
over
eight
times
the
size
of
the
company’s
$6.3
million
series
A
in
February
2017,
and
Clinc
claims
it’s
one
of
the
largest
single
investments
in
the
history
of
conversational
AI.
Investors
were
seemingly
won
over
by
Clinc’s
growth,
which
is
nothing
to
shake
a
stick
at,
to
be
sure.
Last
year,
the
firm
saw
a
300%
uptick
in
revenue
and
expects
to
more
than
triple
business
this
year.
And
Clinc
claims
its
technologies
are
accessible
to
over
30
million
users
via
customers
such
as
USAA,
Ford,
İşbank,
Barclays,
and
others
in
verticals
such
as
automotive,
health
care,
travel,
hospitality,
banking,
customer
service,
insurance,
and
food
service.
“We’ve
had
phenomenal
growth
and
built
unbelievable
momentum
in
a
very
short
period
of
time,”
said
CEO
Jason
Mars,
who’s
also
an
assistant
professor
of
computer
science
at
the
University
of
Michigan.
He
adds
that
the
capital
infusion
will
enable
Clinc
to
expand
its
workforce
to
140
people
by
next
year
and
open
a
new
26,000
square
foot
office
in
Ann
Arbor.
“Now
we’re
adding
more
world-class
investors
to
support
our
growing
team
as
we
work
to
accelerate
the
pace
of
innovation
and
to
reshape
the
conversational
AI
landscape,
one
industry
at
a
time.”
Clinc’s
tech,
like
Apple’s
Siri
or
Google
Assistant,
leverages
a
combination
of
natural
language
processing
(NLP)
engines,
machine
learning,
and
deep
neural
networks
to
make
sense
of
human
speech.
It
can
suss
out
the
semantics,
context,
intent,
and
meaning
of
utterances
by
analyzing
dozens
of
factors
like
speech
patterns,
the
company
says.
And
it’s
able
to
parse
unstructured
speech,
enabling
it
to
self-improve
over
time
and
recognize
follow-up
questions
it’s
never
heard
before.
As
Mars
explained
to
VentureBeat
in
an
interview
earlier
this
year,
Clinc
builds
corpa
by
posing
open-ended
questions
to
a
large
number
of
native
speakers,
like
“If
you
could
talk
to
your
phone
and
ask
about
your
personal
finances,
what
would
you
say?”
It
treats
the
responses
as
“tuner”
datasets
for
real-world
use,
and
so
long
as
the
datasets
are
curated
and
created
in
a
native
language,
Clinc
can
add
support
for
a
language
with
just
three
to
500
utterances.
That’s
thousands
fewer
than
are
required
with
traditional,
statistical
methods.

One
of
the
company’s
latest
pursuits
—
its
automotive
platform,
which
was
announced
in
September
2018
—
is
enabling
drivers
and
passengers
to
control
vehicle
systems
using
natural
language
in
Ford’s
connected
car
lab,
said
Mars.
They
can
make
verbal
requests
to
turn
up
the
air
conditioning,
adjust
cruise
control,
and
check
fuel
mileage,
or
ask
if
there’s
enough
gas
for
a
trip
to
a
specific
address.
Prior
to
the
Ford
partnership,
Clinc
mostly
provided
NLP
solutions
for
large
financial
institutions
like
the
aforementioned
İşbank,
the
largest
private
bank
in
Turkey,
and
fintech
startups
such
as
Bankjoy,
which
provides
mobile
banking
applications
for
credit
unions
and
small
banks.
It’s
also
involved
in
research
programs
with
Intel,
IBM
Corp,
and
the
National
Science
Foundation,
and
last
year
unveiled
a
product
for
drive-thru
restaurants.
“We
are
thrilled
to
welcome
Clinc
into
the
Insight
portfolio
and
partner
to
help
global
companies
deploy
conversational
AI
to
scale
their
businesses,”
said
Insight
Partners
managing
director
Jeff
Lieberman,
who
will
join
the
company’s
board
of
directors
along
with
DJF
Growth’s
Randy
Glein.
“At
Insight
we
look
for
companies
utilizing
the
most
innovative
technological
advancements
and
Clinc
has
shown
this
with
their
conversational
AI
experiences
and
virtual
assistant
solutions
that
mimic
human
intelligence.
We
look
forward
to
working
together
to
further
Clinc’s
growth
and
scale
their
business.”
Clinc
is
in
a
lucrative
line
of
business.
Market
Research
Future
estimates
that
by
2023,
the
voice
assistant
market
will
be
worth
$7.8
billion,
fueled
by
a
steady
uptick
in
smartphone,
smart
speaker,
smart
TV,
and
smart
display
adoption.
Broadly
speaking,
voice-enabled
product
usage
is
on
the
rise.
ComScore
estimates
that
50%
of
searches
will
be
conducted
with
voice
by
2020,
and
OC&amp;C
Strategy
Consultants
forecasts
that
voice
ecommerce
sales
could
hit
$40
billion
in
the
U.S.
alone
in
the
next
three
years.
Moreover,
U.K.
-based
analysts
at
Juniper
Research
anticipates
that
there
will
be
8
billion
digital
voice
assistants
in
use
within
four
years,
up
from
the
2.5
billion
assistants
in
use
at
the
end
of
2018.
