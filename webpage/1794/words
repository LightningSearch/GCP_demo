If
you&#8217;ve
been
around
Artificial
Intelligence
(AI)
you
have
undoubtedly
heard
of
&#8216;
The
Turing
Test
&#8216;. 
This
was
a
test
first
proposed
by
Alan
Turing
in
1950,
the
test
was
designed
to
be
the
ultimate
experiment
on
whether
or
not
an
AI
has
achieved
human
level
intelligence.
Conceptually,
if
the
AI
is
able
to
pass
the
test,
it
has
achieved
intelligence
that
is
equivalent
to,
or
indistinguishable
from
that
of
a
human.
We
will
explore
who
Alan
Turing
is,
what
the
test
is,
why
it
matters,
and
why
the
definition
of
the
test
may
need
to
evolve.
Who
is
Alan
Turing?
Turing
is
an
eccentric
British
Mathematician
who
is
recognized
for
his
futurist
ground
breaking
ideas.
In
1935,
at
the
age
of
22
his
work
on
probability
theory
won
him
a
Fellowship
of
King&#8217;s
College,
University
of
Cambridge.
His
abstract
mathematical
ideas
served
to
push
him
in
a
completely
different
direction
in
a
field
that
was
yet
to
be
invented.
In
1936,
Turing
published
a
paper
that
is
now
recognized
as
the
foundation
of
computer
science.
This
is
where
he
invented
the
concept
of
 a
‘Universal
Machine’
that
could
decode
and
perform
any
set
of
instructions.
In
1939,
Turing
was
recruited
by
the
British
government’s
code-breaking
department.
At
the
time
Germany
was
using
what
is
called
an
&#8216;
enigma
machine
&#8216;
to
encipher
all
its
military
and
naval
signals.
Turing
rapidly
developed
a
new
machine
(
the
‘Bombe
’)
which
was
capable
of
breaking
Enigma
messages
on
an
industrial
scale.
This
development
has
been
deemed
as
instrumental
in
assisting
in
pushing
back
the
aggression&#8217;s
of
Nazi
Germany.
In
1946,
Turing
returned
to
working
on
his
revolutionary
idea
published
in
1936
to
develop
an
electronic
computer,
capable
of
running
various
types
of
computations.
He
produced
a
detailed
design
for
what
was
was
called
the
Automatic
Computing
Engine
(ACE.)
In
1950,
Turing
published
his
seminal
work
asking
if
a
&#8220;
Machine
Can
Think?
&#8220;. 
This
paper
completely
transformed
both
computer
science
and
AI.
In
1952,
after
being
reported
to
the
police
by
a
young
man,
Turing
was
convicted
of
gross
indecency
due
to
his
homosexual
activities. 
Due
to
this
his
security
clearance
for
the
government
was
revoked,
and
his
career
was
destroyed.
In
order
to
punish
him
he
was
chemically
castrated.
With
his
life
shattered
he
was
later
discovered
in
his
home
by
his
cleaner
on
8
June,
1954.
He
had
died
from
cyanide
poisoning
the
day
before.
A
partly
eaten
apple
lay
next
to
his
body.
The
coroner’s
verdict
was
suicide.
Fortunately,
his
legacy
continues
to
live
on.
What
is
the
Turing
Test?
In
1950,
Alan
Turing
published
a
seminal
paper
titled
&#8220;
Computing
Machinery
and
Intelligence
&#8221;
in
Mind
magazine.
In
this
detailed
paper
the
question
&#8220;Can
Machines
Think?&#8221;
was
proposed.
The
paper
suggested
abandoning
the
quest
to
define
if
a
machine
can
think,
to
instead
test
the
machine
with
the
‘imitation
game’.
This
simple
game
is
played
with
three
people:
a
man
(A)
a
woman
(B),
and
an
interrogator
(C)
who
may
be
of
either
sex.
The
concept
of
the
game
is
that
the
interrogator
stays
in
a
room
that
is
separate
from
both
the
man
(A)
and
the
woman
(B),
the
goal
is
for
the
interrogator
to
identify
who
the
man
is,
and
who
the
woman
is.
In
this
instance
the
goal
of
the
man
(A)
is
to
deceive
the
interrogator,
meanwhile
the
woman
(B)
can
attempt
to
help
the
interrogator
(C).
To
make
this
fair,
no
verbal
cues
can
be
used,
instead
only
typewritten
questions
and
answers
are
sent
back
and
forth.
The
question
then
becomes:
How
does
the
interrogator
know
who
to
trust?
The
interrogator
only
knows
them
by
the
labels
X
and
Y,
and
at
the
end
of
the
game
he
simply
states
either
‘X
is
A
and
Y
is
B’
or
‘X
is
B
and
Y
is
A’.
The
question
then
becomes,
if
we
remove
the
man
(A)
or
the
woman
(B),
and
replace
that
person
with
an
intelligent
machine,
can
the
machine
use
its
AI
system
to
trick
the
interrogator
(C)
into
believing
that
it&#8217;s
a
man
or
a
woman?
This
is
in
essence
the
nature
of
the
Turing
Test.
In
other
words
if
you
were
to
communicate
with
an
AI
system
unknowingly,
and
you
assumed
that
the
&#8216;entity&#8217;
on
the
other
end
was
a
human,
could
the
AI
deceive
you
indefinitely?
Why
the
Turing
Test
Matters
In
Alan
Turing&#8217;s
paper
he
alluded
to
the
fact
that
he
believed
that
the
Turing
Test
could
eventually
be
beat.
He
states:
&#8220;
by
the
year
2000
I
believe
that
in
about
fifty
years’
time
it
will
be
possible
to
programme
computers,
with
a
storage
capacity
of
about
10
9
,
to
make
them
play
the
imitation
game
so
well
that
an
average
interrogator
will
not
have
more
than
70
per
cent,
chance
of
making
the
right
identification
after
five
minutes
of
questioning.
&#8221;
When
looking
at
the
Turing
Test
through
a
modern
lens
it
seems
very
possible
that
an
AI
system
could
trick
a
human
for
five
minutes.
How
often
have
humans
interacted
with
support
chatbots
not
knowing
if
the
chatbot
is
a
human
or
a
bot?
There
have
been
many
reports
of
the
Turing
Test
being
passed.
In
2014,
a
chatbot
program
named
Eugene
Goostman
,
which
simulates
a
13-year-old
Ukrainian
boy,
is
said
to
have
passed
the
Turing
test
at
an
event
organised
by
the
University
of
Reading.
The
chatbot
apparently
convinced
33%
of
the
judges
at
the
Royal
Society
in
London
that
it
was
human.
Nonetheless
critics
were
fast
to
point
out
the
inadequacies
of
the
test,
the
fact
that
so
many
judges
were
not
convinced,
the
duration
of
the
test
(only
5
minutes),
as
well
as
the
lack
of
forthcoming
evidence
for
this
achievement.
In
2018,
a
Google
Duplex
reservation
system
with
the
assistance
of
Google
Assistant,
made
a
phone
call
to
a
hair
salon
to
schedule
an
appointment
for
a
haircut.
In
this
case,
the
AI
system
did
not
introduce
itself
as
AI,
and
during
the
phone
call
pretended
to
be
human
while
speaking
to
a
salon&#8217;s
receptionist.
After
a
short
exchange,
a
haircut
was
successfully
scheduled
and
both
parties
hung
up.

Nonetheless,
it
an
age
of
Natural
Language
Processing
(NLP),
with
its
subfields
of
Natural-language
understanding
(NLU)
and
natural-language
interpretation
(NLI),
the
question
needs
to
be
asked,
if
a
machine
is
asking
and
answering
questions
without
fully
understanding
the
context
behind
what
it
says
is
the
machine
truly
intelligent?
After
all,
if
you
review
the
technology
behind
Watson
,
a
computer
system
capable
of
answering
questions
posed
in
natural
language,
developed
by
IBM
to
defeat
Jeopardy
champions,
it
becomes
apparent
that
Watson
was
able
to
beat
the
world
champions
by
downloading
a
large
chunk
of
the
world&#8217;s
knowledge
via
the
internet,
without
actually
understanding
the
context
behind
this
language.
There
were
200
million
pages
of
information,
from
a
variety
of
sources
including
Wikipedia.
There
was
a
restriction
in
place
that
Watson
could
not
access
the
internet
while
playing
a
game
but
this
is
simply
a
minor
restriction
for
an
AI
that
can
simply
access
all
of
human
knowledge
before
the
game
begins.
Similar
to
a
search
engine,
keywords
and
reference
points
were
made.
If
an
AI
can
achieve
this
level
of
comprehension,
then
we
should
consider
that
based
on
today&#8217;s
advancing
technology,
deceiving
a
human
for
5
or
10
minutes
is
simply
not
setting
the
bar
high
enough.
Should
the
Turing
Test
Evolve?
The
Turing
Test
has
done
a
remarkable
job
of
standing
the
test
of
time.
Nonetheless,
AI
has
evolved
dramatically
since
1950.
Every
time
AI
achieves
a
feat
of
which
we
claimed
only
humans
were
capable
of
we
set
the
bar
higher.
It
will
only
be
a
matter
of
time
until
AI
is
able
to
consistently
pass
the
Turing
Test
as
we
understand
it.
When
reviewing
the
history
of
AI,
the
ultimate
barometer
of
whether
or
not
AI
can
achieve
human
level
intelligence
is
almost
always
based
on
if
it
can
defeat
humans
at
various
games.
In
1949,
Claude
Shannon
published
his
thoughts
on
the
topic
of
how
a
computer
might
be
made
to
play
chess
as
this
was
considered
the
ultimate
summit
of
human
intelligence.
It
wasn&#8217;t
until
February
10,
1996,
after
a
grueling
three
hour
match
that
world
chess
champion
Garry
Kasparov
lost
the
first
game
of
a
six-game
match
against
Deep
Blue
,
an
IBM
computer
capable
of
evaluating
200
million
moves
per
second.
It
wasn&#8217;t
long
until
Chess
was
no
longer
considered
the
pinnacle
of
human
intelligence.
Chess
was
then
replaced
with
the
game
of
Go,
a
game
which
originated
in
China
over
3000
years
ago.
The
bar
for
AI
achieving
human
level
intelligence
was
moved
up.
Fast
forward
to
October
2015,
AlphaGo
played
its
first
match
against
the
reigning
three-time
European
Champion,
Mr
Fan
Hui.
AlphaGo
won
the
first
ever
game
against
a
Go
professional
with
a
score
of
5-0.
Go
is
considered
to
be
the
most
sophisticated
game
in
the
world
with
its
10
360
possible
moves.
All
of
a
sudden
the
bar
was
moved
up
again.
Eventually
the
argument
was
that
an
AI
had
to
be
able
to
defeat
teams
of
players
at
MMORPG
(massively
multiplayer
online
role-playing
games).
OpenAI
quickly
rose
to
the
challenge
by
using
deep
reinforcement
learning
.
It
is
due
to
this
consistent
moving
of
the
proverbial
bar
that
we
should
reconsider
a
new
modern
definition
of
the
Turing
Test.
The
current
test
may
rely
too
much
on
deception,
and
the
technology
that
is
in
a
chatbot.
Potentially,
with
the
evolution
of
robotics
we
may
require
that
for
an
AI
to
truly
achieve
human
level
intelligence,
the
AI
will
need
to
interact
and
&#8220;live&#8221;
in
our
actual
world,
versus
a
game
environment
or
a
simulated
environment
with
its
defined
rules.
If
instead
of
deceiving
us, 
a
robot
can
can
interact
with
us
like
any
other
human,
by
having
conversations,
proposing
ideas
and
solutions,
maybe
only
then
will
the
Turing
Test
be
passed.
The
ultimate
version
of
the
Turing
Test
may
be
when
an
AI
approaches
a
human,
and
attempts
to
convince
us
that
it
is
self-aware.
At
this
point,
we
will
also
have
achieved
Artificial
General
Intelligence
(AGI).
It
would
then
be
inevitable
than
the
AI/robot
would
rapidly
surpass
us
in
intelligence.
