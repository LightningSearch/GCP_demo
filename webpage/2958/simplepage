WHY WE PICKED IT Read More SCROLL TO SITE advisor Taxes Advertiser Disclosure Updated: Feb 8, 2021, 5:44pm The Best Tax Software Of 2021 Kemberley Washington Forbes Advisor Staff Updated: Feb 8, 2021, 5:44pm Editorial Note: Forbes may earn a commission on sales made from partner links on this page, but that doesn't affect our editors' opinions or evaluations. Everybody wants to get filing taxes over with quickly, with as little fuss as possible. That’s why online tax software comes in very handy at tax time. Most people want tax software that’s either free or inexpensive. Plus, you want a trustworthy platform that won&#8217;t try and upsell you at inopportune moments. Forbes Advisor has got you covered. We reviewed six of the top online tax software platforms to help you find the best software for your circumstances and checked out their free tax filing options, evaluated ease of use and customer service quality, and determined whether they were able to handle complicated returns. Here are our top picks for the 2021 tax season. Read more Show Summary TurboTax — Best Tax Software for Ease of Use H&R Block — Best Free Tax Software TaxSlayer — Best Tax Software for the Self-Employed TaxSlayer — Best Tax Software for Customer Support Forbes Advisor Ratings Methodology How To Choose an Online Tax Software Provider Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) About Taxes Our Guides To Taxes Our Guides To Taxes Everything You Need To Know About The Child Tax Credit in 2021 I’ve Filed My 2020 Taxes. When Will I Get My Refund? 6 Tips To Get A Head Start On Your 2021 Taxes 4 Financial Tax Breaks To Help During Covid-19 FEATURED PARTNER OFFER TurboTax — Best Tax Software for Ease of Use 5.0 Our ratings take the following features into account and weight them according to category: cost to file your state and federal taxes, what forms you can file for free, ease of use and quality of help content and customer service. Federal Filing Fee $45 State Filing Fee $40 Learn More On intuit's Secure Website Federal Filing Fee $45 State Filing Fee $40 Why We Picked It If you need extra hand-holding and educational resources while filing your taxes, TurboTax Deluxe might be your best tax software option. TurboTax offers good customer service and great tools. And the Q&amp;A process that leads you through completing your tax return is far and away the clearest and most helpful offered by any competitor. The TurboTax platform asks you questions and guides you as you fill in personal and tax information, ensuring you complete all the forms necessary to finish your tax return. Along the way, it offers help topics you can select to learn more about each form, deduction or tax credit. We found this extremely useful for someone who may need help understanding tax concepts. The navigation menus clearly direct you to specific tax categories, such as income, deductions and credits. In addition, support options offered throughout the software make TurboTax an ideal option for those who want to “do it yourself” but may need extra assistance with some things. Two things to watch out for: Upsells and fees. TurboTax constantly tries to upsell you to “add-on” products, such as help and support packages to assist with audits, amended tax returns and one-on-one time with specialists. Most filers won’t need to pay for these extras. TurboTax is more expensive than its competitors. Its regular prices range from $64 to $125 (without promotions) for federal tax filing, plus an additional $40 per state tax return filed. Who Should Use It? TurboTax Deluxe is a great option for someone who is a tax novice and needs help with filing their tax return. It offers many bells and whistles, such as well-written, clear educational articles and tool tips to help guide you through the tax filing process. Pros &amp; Cons Simple, easy-to-use interface that helps you identify the tax filing forms required to complete your return Allows you to upload your W-2 to automatically fill out fields in the software Easy navigation to help you find taxable income, deductions and credits Tries to upsell you multiple times during the filing process More expensive than competitors FEATURED PARTNER OFFER H&#038;R Block — Best Free Tax Software for Simple Filing 5.0 Our ratings take the following features into account and weight them according to category: cost to file your state and federal taxes, what forms you can file for free, ease of use and quality of help content and customer service. Federal Filing Fee $0 State Filing Fee $0 Learn More On H&R Block's Secure Website Federal Filing Fee $0 State Filing Fee $0 Why We Picked It If you have simple taxes—a basic W-2 and few deductions, for example—H&amp;R Block Free Online version is the best tax software for your needs. What we love most is that you can file both your federal and state taxes for free. Other software programs, like TaxAct and eFile.com, offer free federal filing but then upsell you to a paid version to file your state taxes. H&amp;R Block has no income restrictions on who can file for free. Programs such as eFile.com and TaxSlayer limit their free filing option to users with annual incomes of $100,000 or less. Finally, it covers the widest variety of common filing scenarios among the competitors we evaluated, including most tax filing scenarios for parents, college students, retirees and employees. Here are some of the forms you can file for free: Form W2, Wage and Tax Statement Schedule EIC, Earned Income Credit 1098-E, Student Loan Interest 1099 R, Retirement Income SSA-1099, Social Security Income Form 8917, Tuition and Fees Form 8863, Education Credits 1099-G, Certain Government Payments (Unemployment Compensation) Who Should Use It? H&amp;R Block’s Free Online version is best if you have a very simple tax filing that includes wages, limited interest income, earned income tax credit, child tax credit and unemployment income Pros &amp; Cons Free federal and state tax filing No income or filing status restrictions Provides the most filing options for employees, retirees, parents, college students and graduates Phone support had longer hold times than competitors FEATURED PARTNER OFFER TaxSlayer — Best Tax Software for the Self-Employed 4.0 Our ratings take the following features into account and weight them according to category: cost to file your state and federal taxes, what forms you can file for free, ease of use and quality of help content and customer service. Federal Filing Fee $17 State Filing Fee $32 Learn More On TaxSlayer's Secure Website Federal Filing Fee $17 State Filing Fee $32 Why We Picked It If you’re self-employed and need a budget-friendly way to file your federal tax return, TaxSlayer Classic provides the cheapest option for filing all the necessary forms. TaxSlayer charges $17 for your federal tax return, plus an additional $32 for state taxes. Online tax software usually charges self-employed filers higher fees than other kinds of users, since they typically require more steps and forms. TaxSlayer Classic is less expensive than the self-employed options offered by TurboTax, H&amp;R Block and TaxAct, each of which charge in a range of about $109 to $130 for both federal and state tax filings for the self-employed. TaxSlayer Classic lacks some of the bells and whistles included with the company’s higher tier, more expensive service options, like priority phone support and live chat. However, if you have a stack of forms and want to file your state and federal taxes cheaply, and you feel confident about guiding the process yourself, this program would work well for you. Who Should Use It? TaxSlayer Classic is best for price-conscious users who have self-employment business income forms and deductions to file. The ideal users should feel comfortable filing their own taxes using online tax software. Pros &amp; Cons Lowest fee among competitors for self-employed federal tax filing Free for active duty military personnel State tax filing fee costs an additional $32 per state Does not provides support help at this product tier FEATURED PARTNER OFFER TaxSlayer — Best Tax Software for Customer Support 5.0 Our ratings take the following features into account and weight them according to category: cost to file your state and federal taxes, what forms you can file for free, ease of use and quality of help content and customer service. Federal Filing Fee $17 State Filing Fee $32 Learn More On TaxSlayer's Secure Website Federal Filing Fee $17 State Filing Fee $32 Why We Picked It We were very impressed with TaxSlayer Classic’s customer support from the beginning of our analysis. The company’s customer service representatives were helpful and professional, and the hold time on customer service calls was less than 8 minutes. Even late on a Sunday afternoon, there was a short wait and the customer service representative provided clear and informative answers to our questions regarding tax expert assistance and pricing. There are multiple ways to contact customer support for tax filing assistance, including phone, chat and email options. While TurboTax also scores very well in this category, we’ve chosen TaxSlayer because they offer less expensive tax expert consulting services. We also loved the helpful articles available throughout the program. While they were simple and didn’t provide a lot of detail compared to Jackson Hewitt, they’re useful for guiding you through the process. Who Should Use It? TaxSlayer Classic is best for users who value great customer service. It offers great support options, including phone, chat and email. Pros &amp; Cons Provides great phone support Educational articles on complex tax topics were clear and helpful Additional assistance from tax experts costs $37.00 (includes IRS audit assistance) Forbes Advisor Ratings Company Company - Logo Forbes Advisor Rating Forbes Advisor Rating - Image Best For Federal Filing Fee State Filing Fee Learn More CTA text Learn more CTA below text LEARN MORE TurboTax 5.0 Best Tax Software for Ease of Use $45 $40 Learn More On intuit's Secure Website https://oc.brcclx.com/t/?lid=26666733 H&R Block 5.0 Best Free Tax Software for Simple Filing $0 $0 Learn More On H&R's Block's Secure Website https://oc.brcclx.com/t/?lid=26667424 TaxSlayer 4.0 Best Tax Software for the Self-Employed $17 $32 Learn More On TaxSlayer's Secure Website https://oc.brcclx.com/t/?lid=26666512 TaxSlayer 5.0 Best Tax Software for Customer Support $17 $32 Learn More On TaxSlayer's Secure Website https://oc.brcclx.com/t/?lid=26666512 <!--ninja_tobody_rendering_done-- > Methodology We began our analysis by looking at eight online tax software providers: eFile.com, H&amp;R Block, TurboTax, LibertyTax, Jackson Hewitt, Credit Karma, TaxSlayer, and TaxAct. We decided to exclude Credit Karma and Liberty Tax from our reviews. Credit Karma is in the process of selling its tax software business , and it remains unclear what this would mean for consumers. In December 2019, the Department of Justice settled with Liberty Tax for not taking steps to prevent the filing of fraudulent returns prepared by its franchisee stores. To evaluate the six finalists, we created two generic tax filing profiles: A freelancer with business income and deductions. A married couple with wage income, a dependent, and child care expenses. Our analysis rests on side-by-side comparisons of each provider&#8217;s features and costs to assess which offers the best online tax software. We reviewed each of the tax online software to determine the following best categories: Best Free Online Tax Software. For best free online tax software, we analysed which provider offered the most impressive overall package of features while also charging no fees for federal and state tax return filings, lacked income or filing status restrictions, and offered the broadest selection of tax filing forms. Best Online Tax Software for Ease of Use. An easy-to-use platform is most important for many users. For this category, we reviewed each offering to determine which platform provided the simplest process for completing users&#8217; tax filing forms. We reviewed each company&#8217;s Q&amp;A tax interview options, looked for the ability to upload W2 forms and automate data entry, explored all navigation menus, and gauged the length of time required to complete the tax return. Best Online Tax Software for the Self-Employed. Self-employed, freelance workers generally have more complicated income tax filings. Ensuring that online tax software caters to the special needs of freelancers and self-employed individuals is essential at tax time. We evaluated each platform’s offering in this category for pricing, support, state filing fees, deduction finder options, and total costs. Best Online Tax Software for Customer Service. Our analysis included a thorough review of each platform’s support options. We determined if the online tax software provider offered phone, live chat, email, or help articles for users, and evaluated each option. Also, we contacted customer service departments by phone to evaluate its hold time and customer service quality. Each category was weighted and scored feature by feature. The author, a certified public accountant (CPA) with over 20 years of taxation experience, completed all tax software testing by opening accounts with each provider to perform hands-on evaluations. How To Choose an Online Tax Software Provider There’s a lot to consider when comparing and contrasting online tax software providers. Ease of use, costs and fees—including free options—and customer service are the three broad areas to look at when choosing the best platform for you. Ease of Use We know filing your tax return might be challenging. However, some tax software providers can help you ease through the process. Before selecting a tax software provider, consider the following questions: Does the product have easy navigation menus to identify where to input tax filing forms? Is there a Q&amp;A tax interview that asks the right questions to guide you to the tax forms required to complete your tax return? Are there multiple support options, including phone, email, live chat, and tax expert assistance, to help you through the process? Is it possible to take a test drive before paying for the product? Costs and Fees Selecting a product that not only fits your needs but does not break your budget is key. It is a good idea to review the price of each product and consider the following: Which tax forms does the product include? What add-ons does the product include? For example, consider whether the product consists of support, a tax deduction finding tool, or a tax expert if needed. Is there an additional fee for state tax filing? If so, how much? Does the product include a flat fee for multiple states? Free Filing Options If you have a simple tax return, including a W2 and a few tax deductions, you may be able to file your taxes for free. Many tax online software providers offer an advertised free tax filing version for simple returns on their website. While these tax online software products provide these advertised versions, you may also qualify for the IRS Free File Program’s tax options (discussed later in our FAQ section). Here are questions you should consider before selecting your product. Which forms does the tax online software provider allow you to file? Is there an additional cost for state tax return filing? Are there any income restrictions for those who may qualify? Are there support options available? Customer Support Options If you need extra hand-holding while completing your tax return, make sure your review support options. Here is a listing of questions to consider before selecting your product: Is there a way to contact support via phone? If so, what are the company’s operating hours? Does the product provide live chat or email service while completing the tax return? Is there an up-charge for additional support? If so, how much? Does the product provide a tax expert option to assist with filing taxes? Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) When are taxes due for the 2021 tax season? You must file your tax return by April 15, 2021. However, the IRS is opening this year’s tax season about two weeks later than usual (Feb. 12) so there’s still a chance they may extend this year’s filing deadline. &nbsp; If you need more time to file, make certain to file an extension to extend the tax due date to October 15, 2021—although be aware that any taxes that you owe the IRS will still be due on April 15. How do I file my taxes for free? When it comes to free tax filing options, all products are not created equally. &nbsp; During our analysis, we reviewed the free advertised versions of each of the six platforms and awarded H&amp;R Block as our best free pick. But while these tax online products do provide limited free filing options, many of the same providers partnered with the IRS Free File Program to offer a different free product for those who may qualify. &nbsp; The IRS Free File Program allows you to file your tax return for free if you have an adjusted gross income (AGI) of less than $72,000. Your AGI is your total income minus certain deductions. Before using this service, you should browse each product offering to see which free product works best for you. &nbsp; While this program has been in existence since 2001, you may not have heard of it. The IRS estimates that 70% of all taxpayers qualify for the program, only a small percentage of taxpayers have used it. &nbsp; Since online tax software providers donate these services, they advertise them very little. The free versions from tax software online providers that you’ll typically see advertised on the top of the page if you Google “file taxes for free” are different. The main difference? The product you’ll find through IRS Free File may allow you to file more forms for free than the advertised version. &nbsp; According to ProPublica , some large tax software providers used to hide their IRS Free File version from Google’s search engine. ProPublica found that TurboTax and H&amp;R Block used creative coding to ensure taxpayers landed on their advertised free options, where customers may be upsold add-ons and products (the Free File versions of these products typically don’t upsell). However, Intuit has since changed this practice and H&amp;R Block is no longer in the IRS Free File Program. When should I consider hiring a tax professional? As a CPA and former IRS agent, there are certain filing situations that I believe should be left to the professionals. I have seen many “do it yourself” tax returns that landed in the hands of an IRS auditor. Here are some scenarios where you should consider hiring a tax pro: &nbsp; You just started a business in the 2020 tax year or have a complex business structure, such as an S-corporation, partnership or corporation You have employees or you’re self-employed You experienced a recent change in your tax situation (such as your marital status, dependents, a job change, moving to a different state) You sold a property in the 2020 tax year You worked in multiple states What are the typical costs of using a tax online software provider? Tax online software providers may allow you to complete simple tax filings at no cost. However, tax returns that may require more tax forms range from $17 to $110 for &#8220;do it yourself&#8221; online tax products. In addition to the federal cost filing, you may expect a cost to file your state tax return. State tax filings can range from about $28 to $45 per state return. How do I claim my Economic Impact Payment (aka stimulus check) on my tax return? If you did not receive all or part of your Economic Impact Payments (aka stimulus checks), you can claim them on your 2020 tax return through the Recovery Rebate Credit . The credit will either increase your tax refund or reduce the amount you owe (and the credit will apply for both the first and second stimulus payments). &nbsp; To determine your claim amount, refer to your Notice 1444 , which provides the first stimulus check payment, and Notice 1444-B for the second round of stimulus checks. The IRS should send these notices by mail to each payment recipient. &nbsp; This information must be included on the Recovery Rebate Credit worksheet when completing your tax return. If you received the full Economic Impact Payment, you aren’t required to complete the Recovery Rebate Credit information on your tax return. Forbes adheres to strict editorial integrity standards.
