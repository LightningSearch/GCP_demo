Why
We
Picked
It
If
you
need
extra
hand-holding
and
educational
resources
while
filing
your
taxes,
TurboTax
Deluxe
might
be
your
best
tax
software
option.
TurboTax
offers
good
customer
service
and
great
tools.
And
the
Q&amp;A
process
that
leads
you
through
completing
your
tax
return
is
far
and
away
the
clearest
and
most
helpful
offered
by
any
competitor.
The
TurboTax
platform
asks
you
questions
and
guides
you
as
you
fill
in
personal
and
tax
information,
ensuring
you
complete
all
the
forms
necessary
to
finish
your
tax
return.
Along
the
way,
it
offers
help
topics
you
can
select
to
learn
more
about
each
form,
deduction
or
tax
credit.
We
found
this
extremely
useful
for
someone
who
may
need
help
understanding
tax
concepts.
The
navigation
menus
clearly
direct
you
to
specific
tax
categories,
such
as
income,
deductions
and
credits.
In
addition,
support
options
offered
throughout
the
software
make
TurboTax
an
ideal
option
for
those
who
want
to
“do
it
yourself”
but
may
need
extra
assistance
with
some
things.
Two
things
to
watch
out
for:
Upsells
and
fees.
TurboTax
constantly
tries
to
upsell
you
to
“add-on”
products,
such
as
help
and
support
packages
to
assist
with
audits,
amended
tax
returns
and
one-on-one
time
with
specialists.
Most
filers
won’t
need
to
pay
for
these
extras.
TurboTax
is
more
expensive
than
its
competitors.
Its
regular
prices
range
from
$64
to
$125
(without
promotions)
for
federal
tax
filing,
plus
an
additional
$40
per
state
tax
return
filed.
Who
Should
Use
It?
TurboTax
Deluxe
is
a
great
option
for
someone
who
is
a
tax
novice
and
needs
help
with
filing
their
tax
return.
It
offers
many
bells
and
whistles,
such
as
well-written,
clear
educational
articles
and
tool
tips
to
help
guide
you
through
the
tax
filing
process.

Why
We
Picked
It
If
you
have
simple
taxes—a
basic
W-2
and
few
deductions,
for
example—H&amp;R
Block
Free
Online
version
is
the
best
tax
software
for
your
needs.
What
we
love
most
is
that
you
can
file
both
your
federal
and
state
taxes
for
free.
Other
software
programs,
like
TaxAct
and
eFile.com,
offer
free
federal
filing
but
then
upsell
you
to
a
paid
version
to
file
your
state
taxes.
H&amp;R
Block
has
no
income
restrictions
on
who
can
file
for
free.
Programs
such
as
eFile.com
and
TaxSlayer
limit
their
free
filing
option
to
users
with
annual
incomes
of
$100,000
or
less.
Finally,
it
covers
the
widest
variety
of
common
filing
scenarios
among
the
competitors
we
evaluated,
including
most
tax
filing
scenarios
for
parents,
college

and

you

Why
We
Picked
It
If
you’re
self-employed
and
need
a
budget-friendly
way
to
file
your
federal
tax
return,
TaxSlayer
Classic
provides
the
cheapest
option
for
filing
all
the
necessary
forms.
TaxSlayer
charges
$17
for
your
federal
tax
return,
plus
an
additional
$32
for
state
taxes.
Online
tax
software
usually
charges
self-employed
filers
higher
fees
than
other
kinds
of
users,
since
they
typically
require
more
steps
and
forms.
TaxSlayer
Classic
is
less
expensive
than
the
self-employed
options
offered
by
TurboTax,
H&amp;R
Block
and
TaxAct,
each
of
which
charge
in
a
range
of
about
$109
to
$130
for
both
federal
and
state
tax
filings
for
the
self-employed.
TaxSlayer
Classic
lacks
some
of
the
bells
and
whistles
included
with
the
company’s
higher
tier,
more
expensive
service
options,
like
priority
phone
support
and
live
chat.
However,
if
you
have
a
stack
of
forms
and
want
to
file
your
state
and
federal
taxes
cheaply,
and
you
feel
confident
about
guiding
the
process
yourself,
this
program
would
work
well
for
you.
Who
Should
Use
It?
TaxSlayer
Classic
is
best
for
price-conscious
users
who
have
self-employment
business
income
forms
and
deductions
to
file.
The
ideal
users
should
feel
comfortable
filing
their

Why
We
Picked
It
We
were
very
impressed
with
TaxSlayer
Classic’s
customer
support
from
the
beginning
of
our
analysis.
The
company’s
customer
service
representatives
were
helpful
and
professional,
and
the
hold
time
on
customer
service
calls
was
less
than
8
minutes.
Even
late
on
a
Sunday
afternoon,
there
was
a
short
wait
and
the
customer
service
representative
provided
clear
and
informative
answers
to
our
questions
regarding
tax
expert
assistance
and
pricing.
There
are
multiple
ways
to
contact
customer
support
for
tax
filing
assistance,
including
phone,
chat
and
email
options.
While
TurboTax
also
scores
very
well
in
this
category,
we’ve
chosen
TaxSlayer
because
they
offer
less
expensive
tax
expert
consulting
services.
We
also
loved
the
helpful
articles
available
throughout
the
program.
While
they
were
simple
and
didn’t
provide
a
lot
of
detail
compared
to
Jackson
Hewitt,
they’re
useful
for
guiding
you
through
the
process.
Who
Should
Use
It?
TaxSlayer
Classic
is
best
for
users
who
value
great
customer
service.
It
offers
great
support
options,
including
phone,
chat
and
email.

Methodology
We
began
our
analysis
by
looking
at
eight
online
tax
software
providers:
eFile.com,
H&amp;R
Block,
TurboTax,
LibertyTax,
Jackson
Hewitt,
Credit
Karma,
TaxSlayer,
and
TaxAct.
We
decided
to
exclude
Credit
Karma
and
Liberty
Tax
from
our
reviews.
Credit
Karma
is
in
the
process
of
selling
its
tax
software
business
,
and
it
remains
unclear
what
this
would
mean
for
consumers.
In
December
2019,
the
Department
of
Justice
settled
with
Liberty
Tax
for
not
taking
steps
to
prevent
the
filing
of
fraudulent
returns
prepared
by
its
franchisee
stores.
To
evaluate
the
six
finalists,
we
created
two
generic
tax
filing
profiles:
A
freelancer
with
business
income
and
deductions.
A
married
couple
with
wage
income,
a
dependent,
and
child
care
expenses.
Our
analysis
rests
on
side-by-side
comparisons
of
each
provider&#8217;s
features
and
costs
to
assess
which
offers
the
best
online
tax
software.
We
reviewed
each
of
the
tax
online
software
to
determine
the
following
best
categories:
Best
Free
Online
Tax
Software.
For
best
free
online
tax
software,
we
analysed
which
provider
offered
the
most
impressive
overall
package
of
features
while
also
charging
no
fees
for
federal
and
state
tax
return
filings,
lacked
income
or
filing
status
restrictions,
and
offered
the
broadest
selection
of
tax
filing
forms.
Best
Online
Tax
Software
for
Ease
of
Use.
An
easy-to-use
platform
is
most
important
for
many
users.
For
this
category,
we
reviewed
each
offering
to
determine
which
platform
provided
the
simplest
process
for
completing
users&#8217;
tax
filing
forms.
We
reviewed
each
company&#8217;s
Q&amp;A
tax
interview
options,
looked
for
the
ability
to
upload
W2
forms
and
automate
data
entry,
explored
all
navigation
menus,
and
gauged
the
length
of
time
required
to
complete
the
tax
return.
Best
Online
Tax
Software
for
the
Self-Employed.
Self-employed,
freelance
workers
generally
have
more
complicated
income
tax
filings.
Ensuring
that
online
tax
software
caters
to
the
special
needs
of
freelancers
and
self-employed
individuals
is
essential
at
tax
time.
We
evaluated
each
platform’s
offering
in
this
category
for
pricing,
support,
state
filing
fees,
deduction
finder
options,
and
total
costs.
Best
Online
Tax
Software
for
Customer
Service.
Our
analysis
included
a
thorough
review
of
each
platform’s
support
options.
We
determined
if
the
online
tax
software
provider
offered
phone,
live
chat,
email,
or
help
articles
for
users,
and
evaluated
each
option.
Also,
we
contacted
customer
service
departments
by
phone
to
evaluate
its
hold
time
and
customer
service
quality.
Each
category
was
weighted
and
scored
feature
by
feature.

How
To
Choose
an
Online
Tax
Software
Provider
There’s
a
lot
to
consider
when
comparing
and
contrasting
online
tax
software
providers.
Ease
of
use,
costs
and
fees—including
free
options—and
customer
service
are
the
three
broad
areas
to
look
at
when
choosing
the
best
platform
for
you.
Ease
of
Use
We
know
filing
your
tax
return
might
be
challenging.
However,
some
tax
software
providers
can
help
you
ease
through
the
process.
Before
selecting
a
tax
software
provider,
consider
the
following
questions:
Does
the
product
have
easy
navigation
menus
to
identify
where
to
input
tax
filing
forms?
Is
there
a
Q&amp;A
tax
interview
that
asks
the
right
questions
to
guide
you
to
the
tax
forms
required
to
complete
your
tax
return?
Are
there
multiple
support
options,
including
phone,
email,
live
chat,
and
tax
expert
assistance,
to
help
you
through
the
process?
Is
it
possible
to
take
a
test
drive
before
paying
for
the
product?
Costs
and
Fees
Selecting
a
product
that
not
only
fits
your
needs
but
does
not
break
your
budget
is
key.
It
is
a
good
idea
to
review
the
price
of
each
product
and
consider
the
following:
Which
tax
forms
does
the
product
include?
What
add-ons
does
the
product
include?
For
example,
consider
whether
the
product
consists
of
support,
a
tax
deduction
finding
tool,
or
a
tax
expert
if
needed.
Is
there
an
additional
fee
for
state
tax
filing?
If
so,
how
much?
Does
the
product
include
a
flat
fee
for
multiple
states?
Free
Filing
Options
If
you
have
a
simple
tax
return,
including
a
W2
and
a
few
tax
deductions,
you
may
be
able
to
file
your
taxes
for
free.
Many
tax
online
software
providers
offer
an
advertised
free
tax
filing
version
for
simple
returns
on
their
website.
While
these
tax
online
software
products
provide
these
advertised
versions,
you
may
also
qualify
for
the
IRS
Free
File
Program’s
tax
options
(discussed
later
in
our
FAQ
section).
Here
are
questions
you
should
consider
before
selecting
your
product.
Which
forms
does
the
tax
online
software
provider
allow
you
to
file?
Is
there
an
additional
cost
for
state
tax
return
filing?
Are
there
any
income
restrictions
for
those
who
may
qualify?
Are
there
support
options
available?
Customer
Support
Options
If
you
need
extra
hand-holding
while
completing
your
tax
return,
make
sure
your
review
support
options.
Here
is
a
listing
of
questions
to
consider
before
selecting
your
product:
Is
there
a
way
to
contact
support
via
phone?
If
so,
what
are
the
company’s
operating
hours?
Does
the
product
provide
live
chat
or
email
service
while
completing
the
tax
return?
Is
there
an
up-charge
for
additional
support?
If
so,
how
much?
Does
the
product
provide
a
tax
expert
option
to
assist
with
filing
taxes?
Frequently
Asked
Questions
(FAQs)
When
are
taxes
due
for
the
2021
tax
season?
You
must
file
your
tax
return
by
April
15,
2021.
However,
the
IRS
is
opening
this
year’s
tax
season
about
two
weeks
later
than
usual
(Feb.
12)
so
there’s
still
a
chance
they
may
extend
this
year’s
filing
deadline.
&nbsp;
If
you
need
more
time
to
file,
make
certain
to
file
an
extension
to
extend
the
tax
due
date
to
October
15,
2021—although
be
aware
that
any
taxes
that
you
owe
the
IRS
will
still
be
due
on
April
15.
How
do
I
file
my
taxes
for
free?
When
it
comes
to
free
tax
filing
options,
all
products
are
not
created
equally.
&nbsp;
During
our
analysis,
we
reviewed
the
free
advertised
versions
of
each
of
the
six
platforms
and
awarded
H&amp;R
Block
as
our
best
free
pick.
But
while
these
tax
online
products
do
provide
limited
free
filing
options,
many
of
the
same
providers
partnered
with
the
IRS
Free
File
Program
to
offer
a
different
free
product
for
those
who
may
qualify.
&nbsp;
The
IRS
Free
File
Program
allows
you
to
file
your
tax
return
for
free
if
you
have
an
adjusted
gross
income
(AGI)
of
less
than
$72,000.
Your
AGI
is
your
total
income
minus
certain
deductions.
Before
using
this
service,
you
should
browse
each
product
offering
to
see
which
free
product
works
best
for
you.
&nbsp;
While
this
program
has
been
in
existence
since
2001,
you
may
not
have
heard
of
it.
The
IRS
estimates
that
70%
of
all
taxpayers
qualify
for
the
program,
only
a
small
percentage
of
taxpayers
have
used
it.
&nbsp;
Since
online
tax
software
providers
donate
these
services,
they
advertise
them
very
little.
The
free
versions
from
tax
software
online
providers
that
you’ll
typically
see
advertised
on
the
top
of
the
page
if
you
Google
“file
taxes
for
free”
are
different.
The
main
difference?
The
product
you’ll
find
through
IRS
Free
File
may
allow
you
to
file
more
forms
for
free
than
the
advertised
version.
&nbsp;
According
to
ProPublica
,
some
large
tax
software
providers
used
to
hide
their
IRS
Free
File
version
from
Google’s
search
engine.
ProPublica
found
that
TurboTax
and
H&amp;R
Block
used
creative
coding
to
ensure
taxpayers
landed
on
their
advertised
free
options,
where
customers
may
be
upsold
add-ons
and
products
(the
Free
File
versions
of
these
products
typically
don’t
upsell).
However,
Intuit
has
since
changed
this
practice
and
H&amp;R
Block
is
no
longer
in
the
IRS
Free
File
Program.
When
should
I
consider
hiring
a
tax
professional?
As
a
CPA
and
former
IRS
agent,
there
are
certain
filing
situations
that
I
believe
should
be
left
to
the
professionals.
I
have
seen
many
“do
it
yourself”
tax
returns
that
landed
in
the
hands
of
an
IRS
auditor.
Here
are
some
scenarios
where
you
should
consider
hiring
a
tax
pro:
&nbsp;
You
just
started
a
business
in
the
2020
tax
year
or
have
a
complex
business
structure,
such
as
an
S-corporation,
partnership
or
corporation
You
have
employees
or
you’re
self-employed
You
experienced
a
recent
change
in
your
tax
situation
(such
as
your
marital
status,
dependents,
a
job
change,
moving
to
a
different
state)
You
sold
a
property
in
the
2020
tax
year
You
worked
in
multiple
states
What
are
the
typical
costs
of
using
a
tax
online
software
provider?
Tax
online
software
providers
may
allow
you
to
complete
simple
tax
filings
at
no
cost.
However,
tax
returns
that
may
require
more
tax
forms
range
from
$17
to
$110
for
&#8220;do
it
yourself&#8221;
online
tax
products.
In
addition
to
the
federal
cost
filing,
you
may
expect
a
cost
to
file
your
state
tax
return.
State
tax
filings
can
range
from
about
$28
to
$45
per
state
return.
How
do
I
claim
my
Economic
Impact
Payment
(aka
stimulus
check)
on
my
tax
return?
If
you
did
not
receive
all
or
part
of
your
Economic
Impact
Payments
(aka
stimulus
checks),
you
can
claim
them
on
your
2020
tax
return
through
the
Recovery
Rebate
Credit
.
The
credit
will
either
increase
your
tax
refund
or
reduce
the
amount
you
owe
(and
the
credit
will
apply
for
both
the
first
and
second
stimulus
payments).
&nbsp;
To
determine
your
claim
amount,
refer
to
your
Notice
1444
,
which
provides
the
first
stimulus
check
payment,
and
Notice
1444-B
for
the
second
round
of
stimulus
checks.
The
IRS
should
send
these
notices
by
mail
to
each
payment
recipient.
&nbsp;
This
information
must
be
included
on
the
Recovery
Rebate
Credit
worksheet
when
completing
your
tax
return.
If
you
received
the
full
Economic
Impact
Payment,
you
aren’t
required
to
complete
the
Recovery
Rebate
Credit
information
on
your
tax
return.
