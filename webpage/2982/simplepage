Each year new models are added to meet the country’s growing appetite for cushy, higher-riding vehicles loaded with the latest advanced technology and entertainment options. While many consumers may think these pricey luxury vehicles are out of reach, many premium brands have expanded their offerings with entry-level options designed to entice buyers out of their mainstream cars and into the up-market SUV segment. No longer reserved for the well-heeled, several luxury five-seaters, such as the BMW X3 and Cadillac XT4, have base prices that hover around the national average cost of a new car. Automotive data provider ALG forecasts that consumers spent an average of $37,018 for a new vehicle in October 2020. Many recently introduced luxury SUVs are priced to lure shoppers into high-end dealership showrooms and introduce them to the brand’s ownership experience, said Eric Lyman, ALG chief industry analyst. It’s cheaper to retain a new customer than acquire a new one, so winning over younger luxury buyers can pay dividends for years if the customer remains loyal, Lyman said. Beware, however: Staying under budget can be hard in the luxury market for buyers used to value-oriented vehicles bundled with standard features. Luxury vehicles configured with the latest technology and other extras can cost thousands of dollars more than the SUV’s advertised base price. But standard amenities and quality without add-ons typically rivals fully-loaded mainstream offerings, so staying on budget is a reachable goal.
