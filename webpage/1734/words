Quantum
computers
have
the
potential
to
dramatically
increase
the
variety
and
accuracy
of
computations,
opening
up
new
applications
for
computers
and
enhancing
our
models
of
physical
phenomenon.
Yet
while
quantum
computers
are
seeing
increasing
media
coverage,
many
still
aren&#8217;t
sure
of
how
quantum
computers
differ
from
regular
computers.
Let&#8217;s
examine
how
quantum
computers
work,
some
of
their
applications,
and
their
coming
future.
What
is
a
Quantum
Computer?
Before
we
can
meaningfully
examine
how
quantum
computers
operate
,
we
need
to
first
define
quantum
computers
.
The
short
definition
of
a
quantum
computer
is
this:
a
computer,
based
on
quantum
mechanics,
that
is
able
to
carry
out
certain
complex
computations
with
much
greater
efficiency
than
traditional
computers.
That’s
a
quick
definition
of
quantum
computers,
but
we’ll
want
to
take
some
time
to
really
understand
what
separates
quantum
computers
from
traditional
computers.
Regular
computers
encode
information
with
a
binary
system:
representing
each
bit
of
the
data
as
either
a
one
or
zero.
Series
of
ones
and
zeroes
are
chained
together
to
represent
complex
chunks
of
information
like
text,
images,
and
audio.
Yet
in
these
binary
systems,
the
information
can
only
ever
be
stored
as
ones
and
zeroes,
meaning
that
there
is
a
hard
limit
to
how
data
is
represented
and
interpreted
and
that
as
data
becomes
more
complex
it
must
necessarily
become
longer
and
longer
strings
of
ones
and
zeroes.
The
reason
quantum
computers
are
able
to
more
efficiently
store
and
interpret
data
is
because
they
don’t
use
bits
to
represent
data,
rather
they
use
“
qubits
”.
Qubits
are
subatomic
particles
like
photons
and
electrons.
Qubits
have
a
couple
interesting
properties
that
make
them
useful
for
new
methods
of
computation.
Qubits
have
two
properties
that
computer
engineers
can
take
advantage
of:
superpositions
and
entanglement.
Quantum
superpositions
allow
qubits
to
exist
in
not
just
the
“one”
state
or
the
“zero”
state,
but
along
a
continuum
between
these
states,
meaning
more
information
can
be
held
using
qubits.
Meanwhile,
quantum
entanglement
refers
to
a
phenomenon
where
pairs
of
qubits
can
be
generated
and
if
one
qubit
is
altered
the
other
qubit
is
altered,
in
a
predictable
fashion,
as
well.
These
quantum
properties
can
be
used
to
represent
and
structure
complex
data
in
more
efficient
ways.
How
Quantum
Computers
Operate
Quantum
“superpositions”
get
their
name
from
the
fact
that
they
can
be
in
more
than
one
position
at
a
time.
While
bits
can
be
in
just
two
positions,
qubits
can
exist
in
multiple
states
at
once.
Thanks
in
part
to
the
existence
of
quantum
superpositions,
a
quantum
computer
is
capable
of
calculating
many
different
potential
outcomes
at
the
same
time.
Once
the
calculations
are
done,
the
qubits
are
measured,
which
creates
a
final
result
through
the
collapse
of
the
quantum
state
to
either
0
or
1,
meaning
the
result
can
then
be
interpreted
by
traditional
computers.
Quantum
computing
researchers
and
engineers
can
alter
the
position
the
qubits
are
in
by
using
microwaves
or
precision
lasers.
Computer
engineers
can
take
advantage
of
quantum
entanglement
to
dramatically
improve
the
processing
power
of
computers.
Quantum
entanglement
refers
to
the
fact
that
two
qubits
can
be
linked
together
in
such
a
way
that
changing
one
of
the
qubits
alters
the
other
qubit
in
a
reliable
way.
It’s
not
fully
understood
why
qubits
can
establish
such
a
relationship
or
how
this
phenomenon
works
exactly,
but
scientists
do
understand
it
well
enough
to
potentially
take
advantage
of
it
for
quantum
computers.
Because
of
quantum
entanglement,
the
addition
of
extra
qubits
to
a
quantum
machine
doesn’t
just
double
the
processing
power
of
a
computer
it
can
scale
the
processing
power
exponentially.
If
this
has
all
seemed
a
bit
too
abstract,
we
can
describe
how
superpositions
are
useful
by
imagining
a
maze.
For
a
normal
computer
to
attempt
to
solve
a
maze,
it
must
try
each
path
of
the
maze
until
it
finds
a
successful
route.
However,
a
quantum
computer
could
essentially
explore
all
the
different
paths
at
once,
since
it
isn’t
tied
down
to
any
one
given
state.
All
of
this
is
to
say
that
the
properties
of
entanglement
and
superpositions
make
quantum
computers
useful
because
they
can
deal
with
uncertainty,
they
are
capable
of
exploring
more
possible
states
and
results.
Quantum
computers
will
help
scientists
and
engineers
better
model
and
understand
situations
that
are
multi-faceted,
with
many
variables.
What
are
Quantum
Computers
Used
For?
Now
that
we
have
a
better
intuition
for
how
quantum
computers
operate,
let’s
explore
the
possible
use
cases
for
quantum
computers.
We’ve
already
alluded
to
the
fact
that
quantum
computers
can
be
used
to
carry
out
traditional
computations
at
a
much
faster
pace.
However,
quantum
computer
technology
can
be
used
to
achieve
things
that
may
not
even
be
possible,
or
are
highly
impractical,
with
traditional
computers.
One
of
the
most
promising
and
interesting
applications
of
quantum
computers
is
in
the
field
of
artificial
intelligence.
Quantum
computers
have
the
power
to
improve
the
models
created
by
neural
networks,
as
well
as
the
software
that
supports
them.
Google
is
currently
using
its
quantum
computers
to
assist
in
the
creation
of
self-driving
vehicles.
Quantum
computers
also
have
a
role
to
play
in
the
analysis
of
chemical
interactions
and
reactions
.
Even
the
most
advanced
normal
computers
can
only
model
reactions
between
relatively
simple
molecules,
which
they
achieve
by
simulating
the
properties
of
the
molecules
in
question.
Quantum
computers,
however,
allow
researchers
to
create
models
that
have
the
exact
quantum
properties
as
the
molecules
they
are
researching.
Quicker,
more
accurate
molecule
modeling
would
aid
in
the
creation
of
new
therapeutic
drugs
and
new
materials
for
use
in
the
creation
of
energy
technology,
such
as
more
efficient
solar
panels.
Quantum
computers
can
also
be
used
to
better
predict
weather.
Weather
is
the
confluence
of
many
events
and
the
formulas
used
to
predict
weather
patterns
are
complicated,
containing
many
variables.
It
can
take
an
extremely
long
time
to
carry
out
all
the
calculations
needed
to
predict
the
weather,
during
which
the
weather
conditions
themselves
can
evolve.
Fortunately,
the
equations
used
to
predict
weather
have
a
wave
nature
that
a
quantum
computer
can
exploit.
Quantum
computers
can
help
researchers
build
more
accurate
climate
models,
which
are
necessary
in
a
world
where
the
climate
is
changing.
Quantum
computers
and
algorithms
can
also
be
used
to
help
ensure
people’s
data
privacy.
Quantum
cryptography
makes
use
of
the
quantum
uncertainty
principle,
where
any
attempt
to
measure
an
object
ends
up
making
changes
to
that
object.
Attempts
to
intercept
communications
would
influence
the
resulting
communication
and
show
evidence
of
tampering.
Future
of
Quantum
Computing
Most
of
the
uses
for
quantum
computers
will
be
confined
to
academics
and
businesses.
It’s
unlikely
that
consumers/the
general
public
will
get
quantum
smartphones,
at
least
not
anytime
soon.
This
is
because
it
requires
specialized
equipment
to
operate
a
quantum
computer.
Quantum
computers
are
highly
sensitive
to
disturbance,
as
even
the
most
minute
changes
in
the
surrounding
environment
can
cause
qubits
to
shift
position
and
drop
out
of
the
superposition
state.
This
is
called
decoherence,
and
it’s
one
of
the
reasons
that
advances
in
quantum
computers
seem
to
come
so
slowly
compared
to
regular
computers.
Quantum
computers
typically
need
to
operate
in
conditions
of
extreme
low
temperatures,
isolated
from
other
electrical
equipment.
Even
with
all
the
precautions,
noise
still
manages
to
create
errors
in
the
calculations,
and
researchers
are
looking
for
ways
to
make
qubits
more
reliable.
To
achieve
quantum
supremacy,
where
a
quantum
computer
fully
eclipses
the
power
of
a
current
supercomputer,
qubits
need
to
be
linked
together.
A
truly
quantum
supreme
computer
could
require
thousands
of
qubits,
but
the
best
quantum
computers
today
can
typically
only
deal
with
around
50
qubits.
Researchers
are
constantly
making
in-roads
towards
creating
more
stable
and
reliable
qubits.
Experts
in
the
field
of
quantum
computers
predict
that
powerful
and
reliable
quantum
devices
may
be
here
within
a
decade.
