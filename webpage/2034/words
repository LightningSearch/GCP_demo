Julianna
Ianni
leads
Proscia’s
AI
R&amp;D
to
develop
high-quality
computational
pathology
products.
Proscia
is
pushing
labs
past
the
limits
of
traditional
tools
with
its
Concentriq
®
digital
pathology
platform
and
pipeline
of
computational
applications.
Operating
at
the
center
of
the
modern
digital
laboratory,
these
technologies
are
transforming
the
economics
and
practice
of
pathology,
putting
the
power
of
modern,
data-centric
medicine
to
work
in
the
fight
against
cancer.
Could
you
share
the
genesis
story
behind
Proscia?
Pathology
sits
at
the
core
of
biomedical
research
and
cancer
diagnosis;
yet,
while
we’ve
all
seen
digitization
impact
almost
every
other
aspect
of
healthcare,
pathology
has
remained
largely
unchanged
over
its
150-year
history.
It
still
centers
around
a
pathologist
recognizing
patterns
in
tissue
under
the
microscope.
This
practice
is
inherently
manual
and
subjective,
two
challenges
that
are
further
compounded
by
a
shrinking
pathologist
population
and
a
rising
cancer
burden.
Proscia
was
founded
to
advance
this
standard
of
care.
Our
founders
recognized
an
opportunity
to
take
on
the
fight
against
cancer
by
driving
pathology’s
shift
from
microscope
to
images.
In
doing
so
–
in
driving
digital
pathology
forward
–
we
are
enabling
laboratories
to
streamline
operations,
achieve
meaningful
improvements
in
quality
and
productivity,
and
unlock
new
insights
unseen
by
the
human
eye.
Collectively,
these
benefits
are
helping
researchers
to
accelerate
breakthroughs
and
helping
pathologists
to
improve
outcomes
for
patients
around
the
world.
Since
our
early
days,
we
have
amassed
a
customer
base
of
leading
laboratories,
health
systems,
life
sciences
companies,
and
research
organizations.
Among
our
many
enterprise
customers,
we
work
with
Johns
Hopkins
University,
the
University
of
Pennsylvania,
and
10
of
the
top
20
pharmaceutical
companies.
We
also
recently
announced
that
LabPON,
the
first
laboratory
in
the
world
to
reach
100%
digital
pathology
diagnosis,
is
transitioning
to
our
software
platform,
and
the
Joint
Pathology
Center,
which
houses
the
world’s
largest
repository
of
human
tissue
data,
is
going
digital
with
Proscia.
Proscia
is
a
digital
and
computational
pathology
company.
Can
you
explain
to
our
readers
what
this
means?
At
a
high
level,
digital
pathology
is
the
practice
of
digitizing
glass
microscope
slides
using
a
scanner,
which
can
then
be
viewed,
managed,
shared,
and
analyzed
using
software,
including
computational
applications
leveraging
AI.
Proscia
specifically
focuses
on
the
software
side
of
things.
We
offer
a
core
platform,
called
Concentriq,
that
provides
all
of
the
enterprise
functionality
that
laboratories
need
for
carrying
out
their
routine
pathology
operations.
Concentriq
also
serves
as
a
launchpad
for
AI
applications,
including
a
suite
of
solutions
that
we
are
building.
I
highlighted
many
of
the
benefits
of
AI-enabled
digital
pathology,
including
driving
efficiency
and
productivity
gains
and
the
ability
to
unlock
new
insights,
above,
so
let’s
dive
into
some
of
the
specific
use
cases
to
see
how
these
play
out.
One
that’s
especially
top
of
mind
right
now
is
enabling
remote
operations
during
COVID.
As
laboratories
have
had
to
adjust
to
new
ways
of
working
to
accommodate
social
distancing,
digital
pathology
has
enabled
pathologists
to
continue
working
and
serve
patients
since
it
enables
them
to
easily
share
images
and
view
them
on-demand
with
a
platform
like
Concentriq.
The
alternative
is
often
for
laboratories
to
have
physical
glass
slides
delivered
to
pathologists’
homes.
Think
about
how
time
consuming
and
expensive
this
could
be!
More
generally,
when
we
look
at
how
digital
and
computational
pathology
solutions
like
those
Proscia
delivers
are
enabling
pathologists
to
improve
quality
and
efficiency
–
whether
by
making
it
easier
to
share
images
for
a
second
opinion
or
by
helping
to
eliminate
error-prone,
manual
tasks
in
the
lab
–
it
is
ultimately
making
it
possible
for
patients
to
receive
the
right
diagnosis
faster,
and
this
is
important
when
we
consider
that
early
treatment
often
leads
to
better
outcomes.
Can
you
describe
how
machine
learning
is
being
used
in
pathology
today?
Where
is
it
going?
That’s
a
big
question!
Machine
learning
has
really
shown
promise
in
a
number
of
areas
in
pathology.
One
common
use
case
for
machine
learning
in
pathology
is
to
identify
specific
regions
in
an
image
where
tumor
tissue
is
located
to
draw
a
pathologist’s
attention
there.
It
can
also
be
used
to
deliver
quantitative
insights
about
tissue
samples
&#8211;
for
example,
counting
the
number
of
cells
actively
undergoing
division
(a
common
marker
of
cancer).
Some
are
also
working
on
classification
problems,
like
being
able
to
categorize
images
based
on
diagnosis
or
particular
patterns
that
they
represent,
and
still
others
are
working
on
ways
to
use
machine
learning
to
predict
patient
outcomes
or
responses
to
specific
therapies.
There
is
so
much
interesting
work
going
on
in
the
space!
Ultimately,
in
pathology,
most
of
these
machine
learning
use
cases
are
aimed
at
solving
a
few
overarching
clinical
and
research
problems.
The
first
is
the
volume
problem
I
mentioned
earlier.
There
is
an
increasing
number
of
cases
to
review,
and
there’s
this
compounding
issue
of
a
decreasing
number
of
pathologists
available
to
perform
the
diagnosis
of
these
cases.
Much
of
machine
learning
in
pathology
aims
to
improve
the
efficiency
of
diagnosis
at
the
individual
and
laboratory-level.
The
second
major
one
is
the
quality
of
diagnosis
and
care
&#8211;
how
can
we
improve
diagnostic
accuracy,
how
can
we
improve
prognosis,
and
how
can
we
improve
patient
outcomes
at
the
end
of
the
day?
To
answer
the
second
part
of
your
question,
I
should
distinguish
between
what’s
at
the
research
stage
today,
and
what’s
actually
happening
in
clinical
practice.
Right
now,
most
of
the
work
in
the
field
has
been
research,
and
it
can
be
extremely
challenging
to
translate
some
of
the
findings
to
clinical
practice.
That’s
where
I
think
machine
learning
is
going
and
needs
to
go
&#8211;
building
out
the
systems
and
the
level
of
quality
needed
to
actually
put
some
of
the
fantastic
research
being
done
into
practice,
in
a
way
that
holds
up
to
all
of
the
amazing
findings
we’re
seeing
in
the
research
setting
and
delivering
these
benefits
to
pathology
labs
and
ultimately
their
patients.
Building
AI
that
works
in
the
“real
world”
is
and
has
always
been
Proscia’s
approach.
Proscia’s
DermAI
leverages
deep
learning
to
pre-screen
and
automatically
classify
hundreds
of
variants
of
skin
disease
into
pre-diagnostic
categories.
What
were
your
key
considerations
in
designing
and
developing
this
application?
First
and
foremost,
we
had
to
consider
what
we
were
building
the
system
to
do.
We
wanted
it
to
be
able
to
classify
any
skin
lesion,
not
just
a
specific
type.
And
there
is
quite
a
lot
of
variability
in
skin
pathology,
as
you
said,
hundreds
of
variants.
So,
we
needed
to
make
sure
we
had
all
of
that
variation
well-represented
in
our
training
set.
This
can
actually
be
quite
challenging,
as
some
types
of
lesions
are
rarer
than
others,
and
it
can
be
difficult
to
build
a
dataset
that
has
enough
examples
of
some
of
these
rarer
pathologies
to
train
with
and
ensure
that
we
had
enough
examples
for
our
model
to
learn
from.
Second,
we
really
had
to
think
about
the
fact
that
we
weren’t
just
building
something
that
needed
to
work
at
a
single
site,
or
for
images
scanned
with
a
particular
type
of
scanner.
It
was
really
about
building
something
that
could
work
on
any
laboratory’s
images,
on
any
scanner.
There
can
be
quite
a
lot
of
variation
between
sites
and
scanners
in
terms
of
the
appearance
of
the
image
&#8211;
colors,
lightness,
artifacts
etc.
We
had
to
develop
a
system
that
could
account
for
all
of
these
variations,
and
not
require
a
massive
amount
of
data
to
calibrate
and
get
it
working
for
a
new
site.
We
had
several
other
considerations
to
account
for
in
terms
of
building
an
AI
system
that
could
operate
in
the
“real
world.”
One
more,
which
was
especially
important
for
us,
was
representing
the
“unknowns.”
After
all,
we
know
that
AI
systems
are
never
perfect,
and
there’s
so
much
variability
in
skin
lesions.
We
needed
DermAI
to
know
what
it
didn’t
know
and
be
able
to
deliver
that
information
when
it
was
too
uncertain
to
make
a
good
classification.
That’s
why
we
built
into
the
system
a
method
to
assign
each
classification
a
confidence
score,
and
we
took
care
to
design
this
in
such
a
way
that
it
would
be
correlated
with
the
system’s
performance
&#8211;
the
higher
the
confidence
score,
the
more
likely
that
classification
is
to
be
correct.
This
means
we
can
basically
tune
system
performance;
if
the
way
I’m
using
this
in
my
lab
requires
extremely
high
accuracy,
I
can
set
DermAI
to
deliver
high-confidence
classifications
only.
If
my
use
case
is
a
little
more
tolerant
of
error
and
I
prefer
to
have
more
cases
classified,
then
I
can
include
lower-confidence
classifications
as
well.
DermAI
was
validated
in
one
of
pathology’s
most
comprehensive
studies
to
date.
Can
you
summarize
the
study
and
its
key
takeaways?
This
was
a
study
of
extremely
ambitious
scope.
As
I
just
mentioned,
there’s
a
tremendous
amount
of
variability
in
skin
lesions,
which
translates
into
their
corresponding
pathology
images,
and
we
wanted
to
develop
a
system
that
could
automatically
classify
any
routinely
prepared
skin
pathology
slide
–
from
any
lab
and
any
scanner.
The
idea
was
that
pathologists
could
use
it
to
sort
and
triage
cases
before
they
sit
down
to
make
a
diagnosis
&#8211;
prioritizing
cases
in
an
order
that
makes
sense
rather
than
in
the
random
order
they
naturally
come
in
and
making
sure
the
right
cases
go
to
the
right
pathologist
rather
than
having
to
be
sent
somewhere
else
later.
And
no
one
had
demonstrated
anything
close
to
that
when
we
began
developing
this
a
few
years
ago.
The
system
we
developed
broke
down
the
task
of
classifying
images
into
multiple
stages
using
a
combination
of
deep
learning
and
basic
computer
vision
techniques
&#8211;
detecting
the
tissue
on
the
slide,
adapting
the
image
appearance
so
that
it’s
in
a
familiar
space
to
the
trained
system,
detecting
the
relevant
regions
of
interest,
and
finally
making
a
classification
into
four
different
categories
based
on
the
patterns
present
in
the
tissue.
The
important
part
though,
was
how
we
tested
it.
While
we
only
trained
the
system
on
5,000
images
from
a
single
site,
we
calibrated
and
tested
it
on
almost
three
times
as
many
images
from
three
entirely
separate
institutions
whose
data
our
system
had
never
seen.
By
doing
this,
we
showed
it
was
possible
to
build
an
AI
application
to
sort
and
triage
skin
biopsies,
that
could
perform
well
on
multiple
sites
with
minimal
calibration.
Since
the
data
we
tested
on
mimicked
each
of
these
sites’
prospective
workload,
we
could
be
confident
that
the
performance
demonstrated
here
would
be
comparable
to
what
we’d
see
if
we
were
to
install
DermAI
in
a
lab.
And
because
the
system
is
tunable
by
adjusting
the
confidence
threshold
I
mentioned
before,
depending
on
what
percentage
of
images
we
classify,
we
can
tune
it
up
to
at
least
98%
accuracy.
One
of
the
observations
in
the
study
was
how
deep
learning
algorithms
can
be
sensitive
to
image
artifacts.
What
precisely
are
these
image
artifacts
in
this
case
and
what
are
some
solutions
to
solve
this
problem?
Yes,
a
few
studies
have
demonstrated
the
sensitivity
of
AI
systems
to
image
artifacts
in
pathology
as
in
any
other
field.
These
are
often
simple
things
that
our
human
brains
overlook
easily
&#8211;
dirt
on
a
slide,
slight
changes
in
lighting,
blurry
regions
of
an
image,
pen
ink
that
pathologists
often
use
to
mark
regions
of
tumor.
I’m
listing
a
few
examples
but
there
are
countless
others.
AI
systems
can
be
easily
fooled
by
these
sorts
of
issues
if
they
haven’t
been
properly
exposed
to
them.
There
are
really
two
routes
to
handling
image
artifacts
for
AI
systems.
The
first
is
by
cleaning
&#8211;
making
sure
that
you’re
training
on
and
testing
images
have
been
meticulously
cleaned,
either
digitally
or
physically,
so
there
aren’t
any
artifacts
present.
This
is
sometimes
easy
to
do
for
a
training
dataset
but
much
harder
to
do
consistently
if
you’re
looking
to
install
an
AI
system
at
many
sites.
So,
we
took
the
second
approach:
making
sure
that
these
kinds
of
artifacts
were
well
represented
in
our
data.
We
didn’t
have
slides
cleaned
before
they
were
sent
to
us
so
we
have
a
lot
of
representation
of
some
of
the
strange
issues
that
you
might
not
see
in
a
pristine
training
set,
but
that
you’ll
certainly
ultimately
encounter
in
the
real
world.
This
way,
we
could
ensure
that
our
system
was
ready
when
exposed
to
these
artifacts
in
images
it
wasn’t
trained
on.
How
are
AI
applications
like
DermAI
being
implemented
in
the
pathology
laboratory?
That’s
a
great
question.
While
different
laboratories
are
taking
different
approaches,
we
believe
that
the
only
way
laboratories
will
truly
scale
their
AI
adoption
is
by
leveraging
an
AI-enabled
platform.
As
I
described
above,
laboratories’
digital
pathology
operations
center
around
a
platform
that
they
use
for
viewing,
managing,
and
analyzing
images.
Proscia’s
platform,
Concentriq,
provides
all
of
this
functionality
and
also
serves
as
a
launchpad
for
AI
applications.
We
believe
that
this
approach
makes
it
easy
for
laboratories
to
deploy
AI
in
practice,
seamlessly
integrating
it
into
their
day-to-day
work
so
that
they
can
leverage
it
at
scale
and
realize
its
true
promise.
Is
there
anything
else
that
you
would
like
to
share
about
Proscia?
I’m
really
excited
about
the
work
that
my
team
and
I
are
doing.
The
unfortunate
reality
today
is
that
we
all
know
someone
who
has
been
impacted
by
cancer
and
the
significant
impact
that
it
has
on
them
and
their
loved
ones.
Our
work
has
the
potential
to
improve
patient
outcomes
and
truly
make
a
meaningful
difference.
This
is
something
I’m
proud
to
be
a
part
of.
To
that
end,
it’s
great
to
see
that
so
many
leading
organizations
also
believe
in
the
work
that
we
are
doing.
Over
the
past
few
months
alone,
the
Joint
Pathology
Center
(JPC),
which
houses
the
world’s
largest
repository
of
human
tissue
data,
selected
Proscia
to
digitize
this
archive.
JPC
has
several
reasons
for
wanting
to
go
digital,
including
accelerating
the
development
of
AI.
LabPON,
the
first
laboratory
in
the
world
to
reach
100%
digital
pathology
diagnosis,
also
recently
selected
Proscia’s
platform
to
scale
its
pathology
operations
and
lay
the
foundation
for
implementing
AI.
LabPON
will
also
collaborate
with
us
on
the
development
and
validation
of
our
AI
systems.
And
finally,
we
recognize
that
we
can’t
transform
the
practice
of
pathology
alone
and
are
constantly
growing
our
team.
If
you’re
interested
in
joining
us,
I
encourage
you
to
learn
more
about
Proscia
and
view
our
open
roles
