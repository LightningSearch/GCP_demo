QOMPLX
Risk
Cloud
QOMPLX
is
a
cloud-native
leader
in
risk
analytics.
Our
customers
rapidly
ingest,
transform,
and
contextualize
large,
complex,
and
disparate
data
sources
using
our
data
factory
in
order
to
better
quantify,
model,
and
predict
risks.
We
help
organizations
develop
more
informed
risk
strategies
and
decisions
for
Cyber
Security
,
Insurance
,
and
Finance
.
Our
unified
analytics
platform
enables
organizations
to
obtain
and
maintain
a
dynamic
and
scalable
view
of
their
critical
risks.
We
bring
together
data
sources
across
your
organization
including
operations,
finance,
and
risk
teams
to
provide
the
ground
truth
of
your
dynamic
risks.
This
centralized
view
enables
more
informed
and
intelligent
decisions—using
risk
as
a
filter
to
focus
attention
on
the
most
critical
elements.

The
Era
of
the
Programmable
Enterprise
The
QOMPLX
risk
cloud
is
ushering
in
the
era
of
the
programmable
enterprise—enabling
our
customers
to
build
trust
and
longevity
in
an
uncertain
world
and
capitalize
on
their
risks
as
opportunities.
Our
cloud-native
risk
analytics
platform
leads
the
way
by
scaling
and
blending
the
best
attributes
of
human
decision-making
with:
Contextual
data
analytics
Scenario-based
modeling
simulation
Multi-dimensional
risk
management
Adaptive
automation
Unify
your
data
and
power
economic
risk
quantification,
mitigation,
&
response
Our
cloud-native
data
factory
streamlines
the
development
of
data-intensive
applications
allowing
clients
to
focus
on
their
business
use
cases.
A
powerful
configurable
core
platform
allows
business,
operations,
financial,
and
risk
data
to
be
brought
together
and
then
directed,
utilized,
and
consistently
managed
across
the
enterprise.
QOMPLX
continuously
collects,
ingests,
and
enriches
all
of
your
disparate
data
and
integrates
them
into
a
centralized
data
fabric
with
integrated
persistence,
orchestration,
and
transformation
engines.
This
dramatically
reduces
the
time
spent
by
data
engineers
on
data
preparation,
engineering,
and
persistence
and
allows
them
to
focus
on
solving
your
toughest
business
challenges,
increasing
the
quality
of
your
analytic
outcomes,
and
maximizing
the
potential
for
growth.
Our
Platform’s
Approach
to
Risk
Analytics
Risk
is
an
inherent
part
of
our
highly
connected
and
interdependent
world.
The
most
successful
organizations
don’t
just
manage
risk;
they
use
it
as
a
competitive
differentiator
to
drive
success
in
their
greatest
business
decisions
and
outcomes.
At
QOMPLX,
we
understand
that
the
ubiquity
of
data
can
make
it
overwhelming
to
identify,
quantify,
contextualize,
and
respond
to
changing
threats
and
vulnerabilities
at
scale.
We
provide
data
infrastructure
that
manages
the
dynamic
digital
supply
chain
to
allow
our
customers
to
leverage
powerful
turn-key
data
flows—ensuring
that
proprietary
data
sets,
models,
detections,
and
even
simulations
are
fit
for
purpose,
traceable,
and
securely
available
for
enterprise-wide
use
at
scale.
The
foundations
of
our
risk
approach:
Visibility
must
be
expansive
and
flexible:
A
modern
organization
requires
a
full
data
and
model
asset
inventory
to
understand
the
supply
chain
that
feeds
its
own
products
and
decision-making.
Risk
is
a
consequence
of
dependence:
Businesses
need
to
understand
how
their
critical
services
relate
to
IT
and
physical
infrastructure.
Risk
analytics,
economics,
and
insurance
are
essential
to
a
healthy
balance
sheet.
Trust:
Authentication
is
at
the
center
of
the
digital
enterprise;
businesses
must
have
confidence
in
it
as
the
“root”
of
trust.
Balance:
Your
strategy
is
ultimately
an
allocation
of
resources
to
anticipatory
and
reactive
investments:
prevention
vs
response.
QOMPLX
helps
focus
investments
to
drive
the
right
balance
based
on
the
threat
models
and
consequence
scenarios
that
are
most
appropriate
for
your
business.
Together,
We
Can
Uncover
the
ground
truth
of
your
risks
That
ground
truth
evolves
with
new
data
and
is
the
basis
for
building
risk
management
and
remediation
plans,
at
scale,
driving
toward
your
most
strategic
objectives
through:
Continuous
collection
of
internal,
external,
and
third
party
data
Utilization
of
synthetic
data
and
simulations
Dynamic
deterministic
and
stochastic
risk
modeling
Quantification
of
potential
exposures
and
exploration
of
historical
loss
events
