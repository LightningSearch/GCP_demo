FinovateAsia
isn&#8217;t
the
only
big
deal
coming
to
Singapore
this
fall.
Courtesy
of
a
partnership
with
conversational
AI
innovator
Clinc
,
Singapore&#8217;s
OCBC
Bank
will
offer
its
customers
a
new
voice-enabled
mobile
banking
assistant
&#8211;
the
first
of
its
kind
in
Singapore.
The
solution
is
called
the
OCBC
Banking
Assistant
and
was
developed
via
OCBC&#8217;s
Innovation
Lab,
where
it
was
trained
both
to
handle
specific
banking
use
cases
as
well
as
the
intricacies
of
local
Singaporean
vernacular
and
context.
&#8220;We
are
always
open
to
forging
new
partnerships
that
allow
us
to
reimagine
banking
for
our
digital
customers,&#8221;
OCBC
Bank&#8217;s
Head
of
Digital
Business
for
Singapore
&amp;
Malaysia
Aditya
Gupta
said.
&#8220;We
choose
to
work
with
Clinc
because
of
their
superior
conversational
AI
platform
and
their
next-generation
natural
language
processing
capabilities.&#8221;
Gupta
called
the
collaboration
&#8220;the
next
step
towards
making
our
customers&#8217;
mobile-first
interactions
more
seamless
and
natural.&#8221;
The
new
mobile
app
will
enable
OCBC
Bank
customers
to
pay
bills,
transfer
funds
between
accounts,
check
spending
history
and
transactions,
locate
the
nearest
ATM,
and
receive
spending
advice
&#8211;
all
just
by
using
their
voice.
Clinc&#8217;s
natural
language
technology
means
that
users
do
not
need
to
memorize
special
keywords
or
specific
phrases
in
order
to
access
many
of
the
most
commonly-used
banking
services.
The
deployment
also
marks
the
first
time
that
Clinc&#8217;s
billpay
competency
is
being
used
in
its
entirety,
a
point
highlighted
by
company
CEO
Jason
Mars.
&#8220;This
is
the
first
full
production
roll
out
of
its
kind,&#8221;
Mars
said,
calling
the
launch
&#8220;a
milestone&#8221;
for
his
company,
OCBC
Bank,
and
the
financial
industry
writ
large.
&#8220;It&#8217;s
not
a
chatbot
or
virtual
assistant-type
experience
that
people
are
familiar
with,&#8221;
he
said.
&#8220;Rather,
it&#8217;s
Clinc&#8217;s
signature
voice-first,
human-like
AI
experience
used
to
create
a
mobile
bank
assistant
that
enables
OCBC
Bank
customers
to
get
spending
insights,
account
and
transaction
details,
and
pay
bills,
all
by
using
unscripted,
everyday,
messy
language.&#8221;
OCBC
Bank
&#8211;
which
stands
for
Oversea-Chinese
Banking
Corporation
&#8211;
is
a
multinational
banking
and
financial
services
entity,
founded
in
1932
and
based
in
Singapore.
With
more
than
$340
billion
(S$467.5
billion)
in
assets,
OCBC
Bank
is
the
second
biggest
bank
in
Southeast
Asia
by
assets
and
one
of
the
larger
banks
in
the
APAC
region.
The
partnership
with
OCBC
Bank
is
the
latest
collaboration
that
Clinc
has
been
involved
in.
In
June,
the
company
reported
that
it
was
bringing
its
conversational
AI
technology
to
the
healthcare
industry,
courtesy
of
a
partnership
with
digital
workforce
solution
provider
Olive.
And
in
January,
Clinc
announced
that
it
was
working
with
Ford
to
bring
voice
recognition
to
the
automaker&#8217;s
vehicles.
Founded
in
2015
and
headquartered
in
Ann
Arbor,
Michigan,
Clinc
demonstrated
its
conversational
AI-based
solution
at
FinovateFall
2016,
winning
Best
of
Show.
Named
Frost
&amp;
Sullivan&#8217;s
2019
Technology
Leader
for
Artificial
Intelligence,
Clinc
announced
a
major
investment
this
spring,
pulling
in
$52
million
in
new
funding
in
a
round
led
by
Insight
Partners.
