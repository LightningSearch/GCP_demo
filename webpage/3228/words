The
India
Today
Group

Today,
Gelsinger
announced
Intel's
Integrated
Device
Manufacturing
(IDM)
2.0
strategy.
Intel
billed
IDM
2.0
as
a
"powerful
combination
of
Intel's
internal
factory
network,
third-party
capacity
and
new
Intel
foundry
services.
"
The
company
announced
it
would
invest
in
manufacturing
expansion
with
a
$20
billion
investment
to
build
two
new
fabs
in
Arizona.
The
fabs
are
expected
to
be
online
by
2024.
Gelsinger
re-affirmed
the
company's
expectation
to
continue
manufacturing
the
majority
of
its
products
internally.
These
facilities
will
be
used
for
Intel
products
but
also
as
foundry
capacity
for
other
companies.&nbsp;
With
Intel
Foundry
Services,
the
company
plans
to
become
a
significant
provider
of
foundry
capacity
in
the
U.S.
and
Europe
to
serve
customers
globally.
In
a
call
with
industry
analysts,
Gelsinger
said,
"My
vision
of
the
future
is
that
Intel
would
have
fabs
that
are
dedicated
to
internal
products,
fabs
that
are
dedicated
and
optimized
for
foundry,
and
flex
fabs
that
are
for
both."&nbsp;Gelsinger
said
Intel
is
using
every
fab
they've
built.
It's
just
a
matter
of
repurposing
it
to
support
new
functionality.
He
stated
that
he
expects
Intel's
engagement
with
third-party
foundries
to
grow
and
span
across
the
core
of
Intel's
computing
offerings
for
both
client
and
data
center
segments
beginning
in
2023.
It's
also
good
news
for
the
Arizona
economy.
Intel
shared
it
expects
to
add
3,000
permanent
high-tech,
high-wage
jobs;
over
3,000
construction
jobs;
and
approximately
15,000
local
long-term
jobs.
He
listed
GLOBALFOUNDRIES,
TSMC,
Samsung
and&nbsp;UMC.&nbsp;The
timing
of
the
announcement
is
welcome
as
the
world
faces
a
chip
shortage
and
the
U.S.
government
expressed
desires
to
decrease
dependence
on
offshore
manufacturing.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Additionally,
Arvind
Krishna,
the
CEO
of
IBM,
joined
the
webcast
to
discuss
how
they
would
collaborate
on
critical
leading-edge
research
for
the
semiconductor
industry
and
a
secure
supply
chain.
The
two
companies
will
collaborate
on
process
and
packaging
research.&nbsp;&nbsp;

SEC
Stumbles
In
Ripple
Case,
Lost
In
A
Maze
Of
Its
Own
Making
This
isn't
last
year's
Intel.
Gelsinger
leads
a
return
to
Andy
Grove's
principles.&nbsp;
Every
company
had
its
fair
share
of
heartache
in
2020,
but
Intel's
product
slips
caused
a
significant
lack
of
investor
confidence
in
the
company.
Meanwhile,
AMD
and
NVIDIA
saw
explosive
growth.
Intel
owns
assets
in
every
area
across
the
computing
stack
from
the
edge
through
to
the
cloud.
Yet,
Intel
hasn't
capitalized
on
its
breadth
of
software,
silicon
and
platforms,
packaging,
and
process
technology
in
the
past
year.
Meanwhile,
companies
like
NVIDIA
and
Qualcomm
have
stepped
up
the
competition
through
both
innovation
and
acquisition.
NVIDIA
made
bold
moves
to
replicate
Intel's
stack
from
CPU
through
data
center
by
purchasing
ARM
and
Mellanox.
Meanwhile,
Qualcomm
recently
acquired
Nuvia
to
add
CPUs
to
its
portfolio.&nbsp;
As
part
of
the
IDM
2.0
strategy,
Gelsinger
spoke
of
how
these
assets
will
drive
Intel's
success.
Admittedly,
Intel
has
had
execution
challenges.
However,
Intel
doesn't
get
enough
credit
for
is
its
breadth
of
hardware,
software,
and
manufacturing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite
the
naysayers,
Intel's
OEM
and
cloud
computing
partners
still
rely
heavily
on
the
company.
Gelsinger
has
already
made
technical
strategy
choices
and
organizational
changes
that
align
with
this
vision
in
his
short
tenure.&nbsp;
Can
Intel
create
a
winning
formula?
The
strategy
is
sound,
but
Intel's
challenge
is
navigating
the
two
years
before
the
new
foundries
will
come
online.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;asked
Gelsinger
this
question
during
an
industry
analyst
call.
He
optimistically
answered
that
it's
a
matter
of
execution
and
repairing
customer
and
investor
confidence
in
the
current
design
process.
He
shared
that
Ice
Lake
was
on
track,
Ice
Lake's
computing
performance
was
above
expected
targets,
and
other
products
such
as
Sapphire
Rapids
are
on
time
for
the
end
of
the
year
with
a
2022
ramp.
He
believes
these
and
other
stated
goals
provide
proof
points
along
the
way
for
its
customers
and
investors.&nbsp;
Gelsinger
also
discussed
how
Intel's
packaging
technology
is
an
important
differentiator
that
enables
the
combination
of
multiple
IPs
or
"tiles"
to
deliver
uniquely
tailored
products
to
solve
specific
customer
requests.
advance
silicon
process
and
packaging
technology
development.&nbsp;
One
could
ask
why
it
will
be
different
for
Intel
in
2021,
and
analysts
did
ask
this
question.
Gelsinger
responded
by
stating
that
Intel
will
establish
a
new
standalone
business
unit
led
by
Dr.
Randhir
Thakur
called
Intel
Foundry
Services
(IFS).&nbsp;&nbsp;The
move
demonstrates
Intel's
desire
to
unlock
innovation
while
creating
accountability.
Additionally,
he
stated
that
"in
the
supply-constrained
environment
that
we're
in,
I
believe
we're
gaining
market
share
because
we
have
supply.
We
can
squeeze
more
out
of
our
factories."&nbsp;
It's
a
bold
move
for
Intel
to
say
that
it
has
a
strategy
that
combines
internal
manufacturing,
outsourced
manufacturing
and
leasing
manufacturing
capacity
to
its
competitors.
While
the
approach
increases
Intel's
flexibility,
it's
a
delicate
balance
to
optimize
product
delivery
cost,
performance,
schedule
and
supply.
It’s
clear
that
it
won’t
be
easy,
but
what's
most
exciting
is
that
Intel
leadership
expressed
that
the
company
is
willing
to
do
what
it
takes
to
compete.
