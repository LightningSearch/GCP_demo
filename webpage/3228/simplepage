Gelsinger, CEO of Intel, shares a vision for growth with IDM 2.0 (Photo by Milind ... [+] Shelte/The India Today Group via Getty Images) The India Today Group via Getty Images Today, Gelsinger announced Intel's Integrated Device Manufacturing (IDM) 2.0 strategy. Intel billed IDM 2.0 as a "powerful combination of Intel's internal factory network, third-party capacity and new Intel foundry services. " The company announced it would invest in manufacturing expansion with a $20 billion investment to build two new fabs in Arizona. The fabs are expected to be online by 2024. Gelsinger re-affirmed the company's expectation to continue manufacturing the majority of its products internally. These facilities will be used for Intel products but also as foundry capacity for other companies.&nbsp; With Intel Foundry Services, the company plans to become a significant provider of foundry capacity in the U.S. and Europe to serve customers globally. In a call with industry analysts, Gelsinger said, "My vision of the future is that Intel would have fabs that are dedicated to internal products, fabs that are dedicated and optimized for foundry, and flex fabs that are for both."&nbsp;Gelsinger said Intel is using every fab they've built. It's just a matter of repurposing it to support new functionality. He stated that he expects Intel's engagement with third-party foundries to grow and span across the core of Intel's computing offerings for both client and data center segments beginning in 2023. It's also good news for the Arizona economy. Intel shared it expects to add 3,000 permanent high-tech, high-wage jobs; over 3,000 construction jobs; and approximately 15,000 local long-term jobs. He listed GLOBALFOUNDRIES, TSMC, Samsung and&nbsp;UMC.&nbsp;The timing of the announcement is welcome as the world faces a chip shortage and the U.S. government expressed desires to decrease dependence on offshore manufacturing.&nbsp;&nbsp; <fbs-ad position="inread" progressive="" ad-id="article-0-inread" aria-hidden="true" role="presentation"> Additionally, Arvind Krishna, the CEO of IBM, joined the webcast to discuss how they would collaborate on critical leading-edge research for the semiconductor industry and a secure supply chain. The two companies will collaborate on process and packaging research.&nbsp;&nbsp; MORE FOR YOU Brazilian Proptech Loft Hits $2.2 Billion Valuation With $425 Million Series D Round What You Need To Know About Amazon Care — The Company’s Virtual-First Healthcare Offering SEC Stumbles In Ripple Case, Lost In A Maze Of Its Own Making This isn't last year's Intel. Gelsinger leads a return to Andy Grove's principles.&nbsp; Every company had its fair share of heartache in 2020, but Intel's product slips caused a significant lack of investor confidence in the company. Meanwhile, AMD and NVIDIA saw explosive growth. Intel owns assets in every area across the computing stack from the edge through to the cloud. Yet, Intel hasn't capitalized on its breadth of software, silicon and platforms, packaging, and process technology in the past year. Meanwhile, companies like NVIDIA and Qualcomm have stepped up the competition through both innovation and acquisition. NVIDIA made bold moves to replicate Intel's stack from CPU through data center by purchasing ARM and Mellanox. Meanwhile, Qualcomm recently acquired Nuvia to add CPUs to its portfolio.&nbsp; As part of the IDM 2.0 strategy, Gelsinger spoke of how these assets will drive Intel's success. Admittedly, Intel has had execution challenges. However, Intel doesn't get enough credit for is its breadth of hardware, software, and manufacturing.&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the naysayers, Intel's OEM and cloud computing partners still rely heavily on the company. Gelsinger has already made technical strategy choices and organizational changes that align with this vision in his short tenure.&nbsp; Can Intel create a winning formula? The strategy is sound, but Intel's challenge is navigating the two years before the new foundries will come online.&nbsp;&nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp;asked Gelsinger this question during an industry analyst call. He optimistically answered that it's a matter of execution and repairing customer and investor confidence in the current design process. He shared that Ice Lake was on track, Ice Lake's computing performance was above expected targets, and other products such as Sapphire Rapids are on time for the end of the year with a 2022 ramp. He believes these and other stated goals provide proof points along the way for its customers and investors.&nbsp; Gelsinger also discussed how Intel's packaging technology is an important differentiator that enables the combination of multiple IPs or "tiles" to deliver uniquely tailored products to solve specific customer requests. advance silicon process and packaging technology development.&nbsp; One could ask why it will be different for Intel in 2021, and analysts did ask this question. Gelsinger responded by stating that Intel will establish a new standalone business unit led by Dr. Randhir Thakur called Intel Foundry Services (IFS).&nbsp;&nbsp;The move demonstrates Intel's desire to unlock innovation while creating accountability. Additionally, he stated that "in the supply-constrained environment that we're in, I believe we're gaining market share because we have supply. We can squeeze more out of our factories."&nbsp; It's a bold move for Intel to say that it has a strategy that combines internal manufacturing, outsourced manufacturing and leasing manufacturing capacity to its competitors. While the approach increases Intel's flexibility, it's a delicate balance to optimize product delivery cost, performance, schedule and supply. It’s clear that it won’t be easy, but what's most exciting is that Intel leadership expressed that the company is willing to do what it takes to compete.
