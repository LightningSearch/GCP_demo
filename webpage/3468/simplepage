These are the details. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) recently signed a deal to become an adviser of a nickel mine called Goro in New Caledonia — which is a French territory comprised of several dozen islands in the South Pacific. This partnership should enable Tesla to procure nickel necessary for lithium-ion battery production during a time of shortages, according to Reuters . &#8220;Nickel is our biggest concern for scaling lithium-ion cell production,” wrote Tesla CEO Elon Musk in a recent tweet. The Goro mine is owned by Vale, a Brazil-based mining company. Tesla is also expected to help with product and sustainability standards. Musk also recently noted that nickel production has been strong in Australia, Canada, and Indonesia, but has been insufficient in the U.S. Prior to this agreement, there were protests due to Vale and the French state offering to sell ownership in the nickel mine to Swiss commodity company Trafigura in early December. Vale ended up temporarily shutting down the site because of the protests. As part of the new agreement, a 51% stake in Vale operations could be held by New Caledonia&#8217;s provincial authorities and several other local interests. And Trafigura is expected to have a 19% stake, which is about 6% less than what was planned before. Tesla is not expected to have a stake in the mine.   &#8220;Our task now is to complete any and all outstanding items to allow the transaction to formally conclude,&#8221; wrote Vale in a statement sent to Reuters.
