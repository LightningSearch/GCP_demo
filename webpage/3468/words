Tesla
(TSLA)
Signs
Partnership
In
Nickel
Mine
Deal
Tesla
Inc
(NASDAQ:
TSLA)
recently
signed
a
deal
to
become
an
adviser
of
a
nickel
mine
called
Goro
in
New
Caledonia.
These
are
the
details.
Tesla
Inc
(NASDAQ:
TSLA)
recently
signed
a
deal
to
become
an
adviser
of
a
nickel
mine
called
Goro
in
New
Caledonia
—
which
is
a
French
territory
comprised
of
several
dozen
islands
in
the
South
Pacific.
This
partnership
should
enable
Tesla
to
procure
nickel
necessary
for
lithium-ion
battery
production
during
a
time
of
shortages,
according
to
Reuters
.
&#8220;Nickel
is
our
biggest
concern
for
scaling
lithium-ion
cell
production,”
wrote
Tesla
CEO
Elon
Musk
in
a
recent
tweet.
The
Goro
mine
is
owned
by
Vale,
a
Brazil-based
mining
company.
Tesla
is
also
expected
to
help
with
product
and
sustainability
standards.
Musk
also
recently
noted
that
nickel
production
has
been
strong
in
Australia,
Canada,
and
Indonesia,
but
has
been
insufficient
in
the
U.S.
Prior
to
this
agreement,
there
were
protests
due
to
Vale
and
the
French
state
offering
to
sell
ownership
in
the
nickel
mine
to
Swiss
commodity
company
Trafigura
in
early
December.
Vale
ended
up
temporarily
shutting
down
the
site
because
of
the
protests.
As
part
of
the
new
agreement,
a
51%
stake
in
Vale
operations
could
be
held
by
New
Caledonia&#8217;s
provincial
authorities
and
several
other
local
interests.
And
Trafigura
is
expected
to
have
a
19%
stake,
which
is
about
6%
less
than
what
was
planned
before.
Tesla
is
not
expected
to
have
a
stake
in
the
mine.
 
&#8220;Our
task
now
is
to
complete
any
and
all
outstanding
items
to
allow
the
transaction
to
formally
conclude,&#8221;
wrote
Vale
in
a
statement
sent
to
Reuters.
