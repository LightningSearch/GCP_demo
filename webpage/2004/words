Crucial
Business
Tasks
You
Should
Never
Outsource
Where
you&rsquo;re
looking
to
fill
a
skills
gap
or
your
company
is
growing
rapidly,
you
may
be
considering
outsourcing
certain
aspects
of
the
business.
Contracting
outside
the
company
can
free
up
valuable
time
and
resources,
which
can
improve
your
bottom
line
in
the
long
run.
However,
not
everything
can
or
should
be
done
by
someone
else,
so
you&rsquo;ll
have
to
carefully
consider
which
tasks
you
pass
off
to
others.

Got
A
Bad
Review?
16
Smart
Ways
To
Handle
It
As
dreadful
as
the
thought
may
seem,
no
company
is
immune
from
their
fair
share
of
bad
publicity.
While
negative
attention
from
customers
or
the
media
is
unavoidable,
it
can
be
contained
and
reversed
if
you
handle
the
situation
properly.
Conversely,
taking
the
wrong
approach
to
a
less-than-favorable
review
or
press
mention
can
irreparably
damage
your
company&rsquo;s
reputation.
