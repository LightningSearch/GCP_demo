Wealth
management
is
a
people
business.
The
biggest
evidence
of
that
is
the
amount
of
technology
devoted
not
only
to
managing
assets,
but
also
managing
people.
That&#8217;s
one
of
the
biggest
takeaways
from
the
new
platform
for
wealth
managers
demonstrated
by
mydesq
during
its
Finovate
debut
in
February.
By
putting
more
information
at
the
fingertips
of
wealth
managers—no
simple
task—mydesq
makes
it
easy
for
managers
to
know
more
about
their
clients,
their
investments,
their
financial
behavior,
their
goals,
and
ultimately,
what
it
will
take
to
build
the
strongest,
most
valuable
client/manager
relationship
possible.
The
stats
Founded
in
July
2014
Headquartered
in
Zurich,
Switzerland
$1
million
in
funding
raised
Milan
Vora
is
CEO
The
story
mydesq
makes
available
on
tablet
everything
a
professional
wealth
manager
needs
to work
with
a
client.
This
gives
wealth
managers
the
ability
to
do
their
jobs
on
the
go.
But
the
real
value
of
the
technology
lies
in
the
speed
and
ease
at
which
it
delivers
relevant
information.
What&#8217;s
relevant
can
range
from
a
client&#8217;s
current
investments
to
the
weather
forecast at
the
client&#8217;s
location.
Whatever
it
takes
for
a
wealth
manager
to
get
up
to
speed
quickly
with
a
given
client—for
example,
handling
an
unexpected
phone
call
from
an
old
client
eager
to
do business—can
be
easily
seen:
Each account
is
divided
into six
key
areas displayed
graphically
with
donut
charts.
These
areas,
including assets,
account
performance,
risk
profile,
even
customer-engagement
metrics
like
frequency
of
contacts
from
the
manager,
are
located
at
the
top
of
the
account
page
and
can
be
analyzed
further
individually.
mydesq
even
displays how
much
the
manager
is
earning
from
the
client&#8217;s
business.
And
because
it&#8217;s
built
on
a
tablet,
navigation
is
a
matter
of
simply
tapping
the
screen.
The
platform
helps
wealth
managers
handle
the
basic
tasks
of
handling
wealth
as
well. The
technology&#8217;s
investment-suitability
engine
makes
sure
that
proposed
trades
and
investments
are
consistent
with
the
client&#8217;s
assets,
investment
risk
profile
versus
product
risk,
and
other
factors.
For
compliance,
the
disclosure
documents,
educational
materials
and
suitability
letters
are
all
available
due
to
the
platform&#8217;s
proprietary
rule
engine.
And
location
is
no
obstacle:
&#8220;Any
regulations
in
any
combination,&#8221;
Vora
said.
&#8220;We
timed
at
a
Swiss
bank
how
long
it
took
a
wealth
manager
to
do
this
trade
and
all
these
other
things
manually.
 It
took
them
17
minutes.
Here
you
can
do
it
in
30
seconds.&#8221;
The
technology
also
allows
wealth
managers
to
show
their
clients
walk-forward,
risk
analysis
models
of
how
the
portfolio
will
be
affected
by
various
stressors
and
potential
market
conditions.
The
future
Reflecting
on
mydesq&#8217;s
Finovate
debut,
Francis
Groves
of
MyPrivateBankingResearch
was
especially
impressed
by
the
platform&#8217;s
ability
to
keep
wealth
managers
compliant
.
&#8220;This
not
only
enables
advisors
to
keep
up-to-date
with
regulations
in
multiple
jurisdictions,
but
also
seamlessly
introduces
all
necessary
compliance-related
changes
to
the
adviser&#8217;s
work
processes,&#8221;
Groves
wrote.
The
technology
was
also
among
the
FinovateEurope
2015
favorites
of
DataMonitor
Financial
Senior
Analyst
Bartosz
Golba.
Adding
new
features,
such
as
Liquidity
Projections
and
KYC
is
among
mydesq&#8217;s
top
priorities,
as
is
keeping
the
brand
visible
via
participation
in
events
like
the
recently
held
Digital
Banking
Summit
in
Barcelona.
From
the
Finovate
stage,
mydesq
CEO
Vora
explained
 his
company&#8217;s
technology
as
more
than
just
putting
a
wealth
manager&#8217;s
Bloomberg,
CRM,
portfolio
analysis,
MIS,
and
more
all
in
one
place
and
&#8220;fit
it
onto
an
iPad.&#8221;
The
goal
is
to
make
wealth
managers
more
proactive,
more
compliant
with
regulations,
and
more
efficient
through
automation
and
other
technologies.
For
wealth
managers
who
share
this
goal,
mydesq
may
be
a
worthwhile
first
step.
