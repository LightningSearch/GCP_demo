Ahead
of
FinovateEurope
in
London
next
week,
we
talked
with Tobias
Christen,
CEO
of
Zurich,
Switzerland-based
DSwiss
,
about
his
company
and
its
flagship
digital
safe
technology
that
supports
the
long-term
secure,
safe-keeping
of
personal
files
and
passwords.
DSwiss
was
founded
in
2008
and
most
recently
demonstrated
its
technology
at
FinovateEurope
2018.
Finovate:
Banks
offer
an
adapted
version
of
your
digital
safe
directly
from
their
online
banking
portals.
But
why
would
people
want
to
save
passwords
and
files
with
their
bank?
Tobias
Christen:
 A
recent
PwC-survey
concluded
that
banks
are
amongst
the
most
trusted
organizations
when
it
comes
to
privacy
and
cybersecurity,
outranking
healthcare
providers,
nonprofits,
and
online
retailers.
This
only
confirms
our
own
experience:
Increasingly,
people
are
looking
for
a
trusted
partner
that
can
help
them
keep
important
data
safe.
Banks
are
really
well-positioned
to
act
as
that
partner
because
of
their
long
history
as
custodians
of
wealth.
The
study
also
revealed
that
only
10%
of
consumers
feel
they
have
complete
control
over
their
personal
information.
In
my
opinion,
that’s
because
they
started
out
making
the
mistake
of
saving
everything
with
companies
whose
business
model
was
to
sell
data.
There’s
nothing
wrong
with
using
social
media,
iCloud
or
Google
Docs
but
we’re
seeing
a
growing
understanding
that
not
all
data
is
made
equal.
Some
documents
are
worthy
of
a
superior
protection
–
copies
of
ID
papers,
financial
documents
and
passwords
for
example
–
and
people
are
really
looking
for
a
safe
alternative
to
store
such
data.
This
is
where
a
digital
version
of
the
bank
safe
seems
like
a
very
logical
place
to
go.
People
feel
safer
storing
essential
data
here
because
the
business
model
of
banks
is
not
based
on
selling
customer
data
but
rather
on
their
ability
to
keep
such
assets
safe.
Finovate:
How
do
you
keep
up
with
consumer
demands
and
ensure
that
the
digital
safe
stays
relevant
to
them?
Christen:
We’ve
had
a
two
string
approach
to
that.
On
the
one
hand,
we
develop
and
market
our
own
B2C
solution
called
SecureSafe
,
which
has
more
than
1
million
users.
Being
behind
our
own
B2C
solution
gives
us
direct
access
to
highly
valuable
user
feedback.
Due
to
the
popularity
of
such
services
as
Dropbox,
SecureSafe
users
started
asking
for
more
advanced
file
sharing
and
sync
capabilities.
We
responded
with
secure
sharing
and
encrypted
sync
functionality.
On
the
other
hand,
we’ve
established
a
highly
collaborative
approach
to
the
digital
safe.
Since
our
first
private
and
cantonal
bank
clients
joined
us
in
2009,
DSwiss
experts
have
joined
forces
with
banks
to
develop
strategic
features
that
fit
their
particular
needs.
In
2011,
we
started
to
work
on
a
patented
single
sign-on
technology
to
allow
for
smooth
integration
of
digital
safes
in
online
bank
portals.
eDelivery
for
the
safe
transfer
of
bank
documents
directly
to
clients’
safes
followed
soon
after.
After
entering
our
first
collaboration
with
a
major
bank
in
2015,
we’ve
been
able
to
speed
up
the
collaborative
product
innovation.
Our
latest
innovation
combines
original
meta-data
that
is
passed
along
with
documents
(or
requests)
and
data
that
is
extracted
with
rule-based
and
machine-learning-based
algorithms.
This
might
sound
very
technical,
but
at
Finovate
London
2019
we’ll
show
you
how
it
makes
onboarding
for
a
mortgage
a
lot
faster
and
easier
for
bank
clients.
Ultimately,
this
feature
makes
any
interaction
between
bank
advisor
and
end-client
user-centric.
This
fosters
customer
loyalty
and
helps
a
bank
stand
out
to
prospect
clients.
Finovate:
How
do
you
keep
up
with
security
demands
from
your
bank
clients?
Christen:
Banks
have
always
been
focused
on
a
particularly
high
level
of
security
and
are
understandably
cautious
when
it
comes
to
collaborating
with
fintechs.
However,
DSwiss
was
built
on
the
principles
of
privacy
by
design
from
the
get-go.
We’ve
employed
zero
knowledge
architecture,
double
encryption
and
triple
data
redundancy
since
the
very
beginning.
In
particular,
our
zero
knowledge
architecture
takes
the
confidentiality
protection,
which
banks
generally
implement,
to
the
next
level.
Throughout
the
years,
we’ve
been
so
fortunate
as
to
work
with
banks
of
all
sizes,
both
private
and
retail.
That
has
enabled
us
to
build
up
a
lot
of
experience
with
the
specific
regulations
that
concern
banks,
such
as
GDPR.
Finovate:
According
to
you,
what
are
the
biggest
challenges
to
online
security
and
privacy
protection
today?
Christen:
In
the
old
days,
cyber
criminals
were
quite
often
isolated
individuals
with
limited
financial
resources.
They
were
principally
motivated
by
curiosity,
pride
or
revenge.
Today,
the
offenders
are
mostly
motivated
by
economical
perspectives
and
they
are
often
engaged
by
governments.
This
means
that
we
increasingly
see
well-organized
and
well-founded
groups
at
work.

DSwiss
and

of
other

latest
technologies
