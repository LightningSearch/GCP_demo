The
Truth
About
3
Common
Conversational
AI
Myths
When
researching
a
conversational
AI
platform
for
your
business,
it
can
be
hard
to
decipher
what
quality
platforms
look
like.
Every
company
has
its
set
of
differentiators
and
value
props
that
&#8211;
to
most
people
&#8211;
make
them
look
sophisticated
and,
therefore,
the
right
choice.
But
the
truth
is,
not
all
conversational
AI
platforms
are
created
equal.
In
this
series,
you’ll
learn
what
to
look
for
when
evaluating
conversational
AI
platforms
and
walk
away
with
the
knowledge
you
need
to
make
an
informed
decision.
Let’s
start
by
dispelling
a
few
of
the
common
myths
about
building
conversational
AI.
Myth:
Gathering
quality
data
is
a
long
process
of
trial
and
error
Truth:
While
it’s
true
that
conversational
AI
products
are
only
as
good
as
the
data
behind
them,
gathering
quality
data
doesn’t
need
to
be
a
daunting
task.
One
of
the
primary
methods
to
both
accelerate
time
and
improve
quality
is
by
leveraging
crowdsourcing
when
first
building
out
models,
and
utilizing
production
data
after
deployment.
This
bootstrapping
method
allows
diverse
data
to
be
quickly
obtained.
There
is
a
reason
the
phrase
“data
is
the
new
oil”
comes
up
so
often,
it
takes
refinement
to
ensure
maximum
value.
Any
conversational
AI
vendor
you
select
should
allow
you
to
easily
collect
quality
data
through
its
platform.
Myth:
You
need
a
lot
of
resources
to
build
good
conversational
AI
Truth:
Building
quality
conversational
AI
products
doesn’t
have
to
be
a
resource-intensive
ordeal
that
requires
trial
and
error
when
training
murky
data
models.
Production-level
experiences
can
be
accomplished
with
a
robust
toolkit
that
supports
visibility
into
how
data
impacts
your
AI
models.
The
ability
to
generate
actionable
insights
on
how
to
optimize
AI
models
and
identify
opportunities
for
future
iterations
is
critical
to
any
AI
building
platform.
These
tools
should
empower
users
to
know
how
to
iterate
on
their
models
to
minimize
errors
and
increase
accuracy. 
Myth:
Building
conversational
AI
is
the
same
as
software
development
Truth:
While
creating
a
production-ready
solution
is
an
iterative,
continuous
process,
it
has
some
distinct
differences
from
standard
software
development
processes.
Conversational
AI
platforms
must
support
end
to
end
and
unit
testing
that
covers
all
your
various
AI
models
and
responses
to
ensure
end-users
will
be
supported
from
day
one.
Platforms
should
also
support
the
collaboration
of
teams
of
developers
that
can
work
in
conjunction
and
coordinate
efforts
to
ensure
streamlined
delivery.
Having
confidence
in
your
conversational
AI
product
means
having
control
over
the
various
AI
engines
and
being
able
to
test
them
thoroughly
to
hit
validation
points
and
prevent
regressions.
