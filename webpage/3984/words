Million

Less
than
a
week
away
from
its
Finovate
debut
in
San
Jose
,
wealth-advisory
technology
innovator,
Trizic
has
closed
a
$3
million
seed
funding
round
with
Operative
Capital.
Operative
Capital
initially
invested
$1
million
in
Trizic,
and
this
week
increased
its
investment
by
another
$2
million.
The
funding
will
help
the
company
roll
out
Trizic
Accelerator
,
its
digital
wealth-advisory
platform
for
broker-dealers
and
asset
managers,
as
well
as
FIs
and
wealth-management
firms.
Speaking
for
Operative
Capital,
founding
partner
Drew
Sievers
highlighted
Trizic&#8217;s
potential
for
disruption
in
the
wealth-advisory
digital
space
and
the
fact
that,
as
a
technology
company,
Trizic
does
not
compete
with
its
customers.
Sievers
is
the
former
CEO
and
founder
of
mFoundry
,
(a
Finovate
alum).
&#8220;Well-known,
direct-to-investor
sites
offering
their
solution
to
financial
firms,
asset
managers,
and
RIAs
have
a
direct
conflict:
Trizic
isn&#8217;t
a
competitive
threat
to
the
wealth-management
providers
that
are
implementing
Trizic
Accelerator,&#8221;
says
Sievers.
Available
as
a
white-label
offering,
Trizic
Accelerator
helps
wealth-management
professionals
onboard
and
manage
both
new
and
existing
clients,
and
automates
up
to
80%
of
back-office
functions.
Wealth
managers
can
create
model
portfolios
and
execute
trades.
The
platform&#8217;s
algorithms
ensure
that
processes
are
&#8220;tax-aware&#8221;
and
meet
regulatory
and
fiduciary
requirements.
Clients
can
have
different
degrees
of
access
to
the
platform
on
the
front
end
based
on
their
own
technological
and
financial
sophistication.
Founded
in
2012,
Trizic
is
headquartered
in
San
Francisco,
California.
Brad
Matthews
is
founder
and
CEO.

Alums
Win
Leading
Vendor
Honors
from
MyPrivateBanking
Research

eMoney
Advisor
,
MicroStrategy
,
Yseop
. What
do
these
three
companies
have
in
common?
In
addition
to
being
Finovate
alums,
all
three
were
recognized
by
MyPrivateBanking
Research
as
&#8220;leading
vendors&#8221;
in
the
field
of
digital
solution
providers
for
wealth
managers
and
financial
advisers.
The
three
companies
join
12
others
in
MyPrivateBanking
Research&#8217;s
latest
report
&#8220;Digital
and
Mobile
Solutions
for
Financial
Advisers
2015&#8221;.
The
report
focuses
on
innovations
and
technical
contributions
to
the
wealth
management
industry
that
take
the
form
of
&#8220;mobile
apps,
digital
communications,
and
analytical
and
social
media
solutions.&#8221;
Swiss-based
MyPrivateBanking
Research
has
for
over a
decade
provided analysis on
how
financial
services
companies
use
the
Internet,
social
media,
and
mobile
to
engage
customers. The
judging
process
for
the
report
included
looking
at
45
different
potential
features
for
mobile
apps,
15
factors
in
assessing
digital
communications
technology,
and
eight
features
for
social
media
solutions.
The
report
includes
analysis
of
each
company
and
its
technology,
as
well
as
&#8220;individual
recommendations
for
each
vendor
on
how
to
improve
its
offerings.&#8221;
From
the
report&#8217;s
executive
summary:
We
see
that
traditional
wealth
managers
cannot
defend
their
business
model
against
robo-advisers
and
other
digital
do-it-yourself
tools
by
merely
pointing
out
that
their
advisers
offer
a
&#8216;human
touch&#8217;
and
specific
banking
know-how.
They
need
to
reinvent
their
business
model
from
the
ground
up
in
order
to
arrive
in
the
21st
century.
eMoney
Advisor
was
highlighted
in
the
report
in
the
mobile
app
category.
eMoney
Advisor
made
its
Finovate
debut
at
FinovateFall
2014
,
introducing
a
&#8220;reboot&#8221;
of
its
wealth-planning
system
for
financial
advisers,
EMX.
The
company
was
founded
in
2000,
and
is
headquartered
in
Conshohocken,
Pennsylvania.
Last
month,
eMoney
Advisor
announced
that
it
had
been
acquired
by
Fidelity
Investments
for
$250
million.

our
Finovate
Debut
post

eMoney
Advisor.
Founded
in
1989
and
based
in
Tyson&#8217;s
Corner,
Virginia,
MicroStrategy
specializes
in
enterprise
software.
The
company&#8217;s
solutions
range
from
its
Business
Intelligence
(BI)
platform
to
its
Mobile
Platform
and
Applications
to
Usher,
the
mobile
identity
network
MicroStrategy
unveiled
at
its
Finovate
appearance
in
San
Francisco
in
the
spring
of
2013
.
Like
eMoney
Advisor,
MicroStrategy
was
also
recognized
by
MyPrivateBanking
Research
for
its
mobile
app
development
platform.
Yseop
may
seem
an
unlikely
member
of
this
trio;
however,
the
company
distinguished
itself
as
a
resource
for
financial
managers
in
the
&#8220;analytics,
natural
language
generation
and
other
solutions&#8221;
category.
An
innovator
in
the
field
of
putting
artificial
intelligence
to
use
to
support
business
operations,
Yseop
has
developed
technologies
like
Yseop
Sales
Force
Productivity
Suite
(demoed
at
FinovateSpring
2014
)
and
Yseop
Financial
Suite
(
demoed
at
FinovateFall
2013
).
The
company
was
founded
in
2008,
and
is
headquartered
in
both
Dallas,
Texas,
and
Lyon,
France.
John
Rauscher
is
CEO.
Also
noted
in
the
report
were
Finovate
alums
Crealogix
(mobile
apps),
Temenos
(mobile
apps),
and
Narrative
Science
(analytics,
natural
language
generation,
and
other
solutions).
