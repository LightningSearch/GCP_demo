Twitter&nbsp;
announced
&nbsp;that
it
has
acquired
the
API
integration
platform,
Reshuffle
.
Reshuffle
is
an
open-source
integration
framework
that
lets
developers
build
workflows
and
connect
systems.
The
complete
team
of
Reshuffle,
which
consists
of
a
total
of
seven
members,
including
co-founders
Amir
Shevat
and
Avner
Braverman,
will
join
the
much
larger
Twitter
workforce.&nbsp;
Twitter’s
new
API,
which
is
2.0,
was
first&nbsp;
introduced
last
year
.
It
was
the
big
update
for
Twitter
because
it’s
rebuilt
from
the
ground
up.
And
it
seems
the
Reshuffle
team
will
accelerate
the
efforts
there.
“We’ve
worked
to
deliver
new
features
faster
and
in
a
way
that
is
more
flexible
and
scalable
to
fit
developers’
needs.
We
opened
up
Early
Access
to
the
Twitter
API
v2
that
enables
developers
to
listen
to
and
analyze
the
public
conversations
happening
on
Twitter.
We’ve
released
functionality
brand
new
to
the
API,
including
hide
replies
and
Tweet
annotations,
and
also
completely
reimagined
the
developer
experience
to
make
it
more
straightforward
for
developers
to
get
access
to
the
API
and
help
them
get
started.
We
recently
launched
an
API
product
for
academic
researchers,
our
first
tailored
to
the
needs
of
a
specific
part
of
our
community,
and
we’ve
shared
our
platform
roadmap
to
give
developers
more
visibility
into
our
future
plans.
We’re
doubling
down
on
our
investment
and
ambitions
by
bringing
the
Reshuffle
team
on
board.
Their
experience
building
developer
platforms
will
accelerate
and
enhance
our
work
by
building
the
tools
that
will
make
it
easier
and
quicker
for
developers
to
find
value
on
our
platform.”
Sonya
Penn,
Twitter
Developer
Platform
Business
Lead
states.
On
the
Reshuffle
side,
the
team
will
continue
to
maintain
its
open-source
project
for
the
developer
community,
but
Reshuffle’s
existing
product
will
wind
down
operations
over
the
coming
weeks.
According
to&nbsp;
PitchBook
,
Reshuffle
was
backed
by
$6.35
million
in
funding
from
investors
including
Lightspeed
Venture
Partners,
Maverick
Ventures,
Cardumen
Capital,
Cerca
Partners,
Meron
Capital,
Dell
Technologies
Capital
and.
Engineering
Capital.
