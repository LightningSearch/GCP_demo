Natural
language
understanding
(NLU)
is
a
technical
concept
within
the
larger
topic
of
natural
language
processing
.
NLU
is
the
process
responsible
for
translating
natural,
human
words
into
a
format
that
a
computer
can
interpret.
Essentially,
before
a
computer
can
process
language
data,
it
must
understand
the
data.
Techniques
for
NLU
include
the
use
of
common
syntax
and
grammatical
rules
to
enable
a
computer
to
understand
the
meaning
and
context
of
natural
human
language.
The
ultimate
goal
of
these
techniques
is
that
a
computer
will
come
to
have
an
“intuitive”
understanding
of
language,
able
to
write
and
understand
language
just
the
way
a
human
does,
without
constantly
referring
to
the
definitions
of
words.
Defining
NLU
(Natural
Language
Understanding)
There
are
numerous
techniques
that
computer
scientists
and
NLP
experts
use
to
enable
computers
to
understand
human
language.
Most
of
the
techniques
fall
into
the
category
of
“syntactic
analysis”. 
Syntactic
analytic
techniques
include:
lemmatization
stemming
word
segmentation
parsing
morphological
segmentation
sentence
breaking
part
of
speech
tagging
These
syntactic
analytic
techniques
apply
grammatical
rules
to
groups
of
words
and
attempt
to
use
these
rules
to
derive
meaning.
In
contrast,
NLU
operates
by
using
“semantic
analysis”
techniques.
Semantic
analysis
applies
computer
algorithms
to
text,
attempting
to
understand
the
meaning
of
words
in
their
natural
context,
instead
of
relying
on
rules-based
approaches.
The
grammatical
correctness/incorrectness
of
a
phrase
doesn’t
necessarily
correlate
with
the
validity
of
a
phrase.
There
can
be
phrases
that
are
grammatically
correct
yet
meaningless,
and
phrases
that
are
grammatically
incorrect
yet
have
meaning.
In
order
to
distinguish
the
most
meaningful
aspects
of
words,
NLU
applies
a
variety
of
techniques
intended
to
pick
up
on
the
meaning
of
a
group
of
words
with
less
reliance
on
grammatical
structure
and
rules.
NLU
is
an
evolving
and
changing
field,
and
its
considered
one
of
the
hard
problems
of
AI.
Various
techniques
and
tools
are
being
developed
to
give
machines
an
understanding
of
human
language.
Most
NLU
systems
have
certain
core
components
in
common.
A
lexicon
for
the
language
is
required,
as
is
some
type
of
text
parser
and
grammar
rules
to
guide
the
creation
of
text
representations.
The
system
also
requires
a
theory
of
semantics
to
enable
comprehension
of
the
representations.
There
are
various
semantic
theories
used
to
interpret
language,
like
stochastic
semantic
analysis
or
naive
semantics.
Common
NLU
techniques
include:
Named
Entity
Recognition
Word-Sense
Disambiguation
Named
Entity
Recognition
is
the
process
of
recognizing
“named
entities”,
which
are
people,
and
important
places/things.
Named
Entity
Recognition
operates
by
distinguishing
fundamental
concepts
and
references
in
a
body
of
text,
identifying
named
entities
and
placing
them
in
categories
like
locations,
dates,
organizations,
people,
works,
etc.
Supervised
models
based
on
grammar
rules
are
typically
used
to
carry
out
NER
tasks.
Word-Sense
Disambiguation
is
the
process
of
determining
the
meaning,
or
sense,
of
a
word
based
on
the
context
that
the
word
appears
in.
Word
sense
disambiguation
often
makes
use
of
part
of
speech
taggers
in
order
to
contextualize
the
target
word.
Supervised
methods
of
word-sense
disambiguation
include
the
user
of
support
vector
machines
and
memory-based
learning.
However,
most
word
sense
disambiguation
models
are
semi-supervised
models
that
employ
both
labeled
and
unlabeled
data.
Examples
of
NLU
(Natural
Language
Understanding)
Common
examples
of
NLU
include
Automated
Reasoning,
Automatic
Ticket
Routing,
Machine
Translation,
and
Question
Answering.
Automated
Reasoning
Automated
reasoning
is
a
discipline
that
aims
to
give
machines
are
given
a
type
of
logic
or
reasoning.
It’s
a
branch
of
cognitive
science
that
endeavors
to
make
deductions
based
on
medical
diagnoses
or
programmatically/automatically
solve
mathematical
theorems.
NLU
is
used
to
help
collect
and
analyze
information
and
generate
conclusions
based
off
the
information.
Automatic
Ticket
Routing
NLU
is
often
used
to
automate
customer
service
tasks.
When
a
customer
service
ticket
is
generated,
chatbots
and
other
machines
can
interpret
the
basic
nature
of
the
customer’s
need
and
rout
them
to
the
correct
department.
Companies
receive
thousands
of
requests
for
support
every
day,
so
NLU
algorithms
are
useful
in
prioritizing
tickets
and
enabling
support
agents
to
handle
them
in
more
efficient
ways.
Machine
Translation
It’s
difficult
to
accurately
translate
speech
or
text
from
one
language
to
another
language.
In
fact,
machine
translation
is
one
of
the
most
difficult
problems
in
NLP
and
NLU.
Many
machine
translation
systems
rely
on
linguistic
rules
to
translate
between
languages,
but
researchers
are
pursuing
more
sophisticated
ways
of
translating
between
languages.
NLU
machine
translation
attempts
to
enable
more
accuracy
translation
by
preserving
the
context
and
semantic
information
associated
with
the
target
text.
The
most
accurate
machine
translation
systems
combine
linguistic
rules
with
algorithms
that
extract
semantic
meaning.
Question
Answering
Speech
recognition
uses
NLU
techniques
to
let
computers
understand
questions
posed
with
natural
language.
NLU
is
used
to
give
the
users
of
the
device
a
response
in
their
natural
language,
instead
of
providing
them
a
list
of
possible
answers.
When
you
ask
a
digital
assistant
a
question,
NLU
is
used
to
help
the
machines
understand
the
questions,
selecting
the
most
appropriate
answers
based
on
features
like
recognized
entities
and
the
context
of
previous
statements.
