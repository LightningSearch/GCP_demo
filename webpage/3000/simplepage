Families, in particular, have gravitated toward the vast pool of larger vehicles that offer a plethora of cargo space, a more commanding driving position and roomier passenger accommodations. Though cars only make up a quarter of all new vehicle sales, there are some that shouldn’t be completely overlooked by small or growing families. Even those with two or three children may find that sedans offer a more enjoyable driving experience as well as superior fuel economy compared with a hulking SUV. Choosing a sedan from the fiercely competitive midsize category will meet the basic needs of a family with relative ease while still remaining affordable. Midsize sedans also are a good choice for families that already own an SUV or crossover, but need a commuter-friendly second vehicle that doesn’t compromise on back seat space for kids and car seats. Stuff-hauling power is still somewhat limited, but a decent size trunk will satisfy the needs of most errand running that doesn’t involve bulky cargo. These are reviews of seven top 2020 model sedans. Six of the seven are little changed for 2021 and we note the changes. Ford Fusion ended production but many dealers still have some new 2020 Fusions in inventory. How we picked them: These family-friendly sedans were chosen based on their interior space, safety scores, performance and test-drive evaluations.

All Camry models carry two sets of LATCH car-seat anchors for the rear outboard seats and an upper anchor point for the middle seat. Coupled with 38 inches of rear legroom and 54.7 inches of hip room, the Camry makes easy work of installing most car seats. Full-size car seats might find a more comfortable home behind the passenger seat so taller drivers can fully adjust their seat position. Storage capacity is adequate with between 14.1 and 15.1 cubic feet of trunk space depending on its configuration. The Camry comes standard with a long list of advanced safety features that helped it earn a Top Safety Pick+ designation from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. It also comes standard with Toyota’s Safety Sense P, which includes a pre-collision system with pedestrian detection, lane departure alerts, automatic high beam headlights and adaptive cruise control. Fuel economy also is a strong point for the Camry. Its various powertrain combinations deliver gas mileage that ranges from 25 to 52 mpg combined when the car is equipped with the optional hybrid engine.

The Accord’s large rear door openings and gently sloping roof both help prevent bumped heads when loading and unloading car seats. The Accord is a winner on trunk space with a segment-topping 16.7 cubic-feet. The 2020 Accord earned a Top Safety Pick award from IIHS, due in part to the inclusion of Honda Sensing safety technology as standard equipment. The package includes collision mitigation braking, road departure mitigation, lane keep assist, adaptive cruise control and traffic sign recognition. The Accord is available with three engine choices, one of which is a frugal hybrid system that delivers the best gas mileage. Fuel economy ranges from 26 to 48 mpg combined. For 2021, Honda makes Android Auto and Apple CarPlay available, dropped the manual transmission, freshened the grille, and replaced the mid-level EX trim with the Sport SE.
