Gary
Goodman
has
been
named
a
strategist
at
Human
Element,
an
Ann
Arbor-based
e-commerce
development
agency.
The
hiring
comes
as
Human
Element
expands
its
strategy
team
in
response
to
its
growing
client
base.
In
the
role,
Goodman
will
help
clients
find
opportunities
for
growth
and
optimize
their
online
operations. Goodman
will
bring
a
deep
understanding
of
the
e-commerce
landscape,
says
Sabra
Bander,
director
of
strategy.
“Gary
will
be
a
valuable
asset
to
our
team
in
many
ways,”
Bander
says.
Goodman
was
previously
digital
marketing
and
e-commerce
manager
at
Equal
Exchange
in
Boston.
He
also
has
owned
and
operated
his
own
luxury
silk
bedding
company.
Through
past
experiences,
Goodman
has
built
an
expertise
in
content
marketing,
SEO,
SEM/CPC,
ERP,
and
Marketo.
With
online
merchants
changing
consumer
behaviors
and
creating
new
opportunities
for
growth,
Goodman
says
he
is
excited
to
put
these
skills
to
work
as
Human
Element
continues
to
grow.
“Most
of
what
we’re
experiencing
in
e-commerce
was
going
to
happen
anyways,”
Goodman
says.
“But
the
pandemic
has
accelerated
the
pace.
For
our
B2B
clients
especially,
the
user
experience
bar
has
risen
considerably,
and
there’s
a
digital
transformation
that
needs
to
happen
to
keep
up.”
Human
Element
has
been
creating
online
stores
for
North
American
clients
since
2004.
Though
focused
on
e-commerce
technologies,
Human
Element
has
evolved
to
deliver
a
full
spectrum
of
services,
including
marketing
and
consulting.
This
has
led
to
the
formation
of
long-term
partnerships
that
extend
beyond
online
stores.
The
expansion
has
stemmed
from
having
more
clients
who
have
requested
more
projects.
“Especially
for
complex
projects,
taking
the
time
to
make
sure
we’re
doing
the
right
thing
—
meeting
the
client’s
true
goals
—
before
coding
even
begins,
is
critical,”
says
Jason
Magee,
co-managing
partner.
