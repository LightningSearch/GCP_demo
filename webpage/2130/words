of
the
most
powerful
technological
breakthrough
since
electricity.

Journalistic
Standards 
We
aim
to
be
accurate,
objective,
and
responsible
in
our
reporting.
This
is
regardless
of
if
the
news
is
based
on
original
reporting
or
reviewing
and
corroborating
with
other
sources.
Our
team
attempts
to
always
cover
news
with
integrity
and
impartiality
without
external
influence
from
owners,
or
investors.
We
may
publish
news
more
regularly
from
companies
that
have
partnered
with
our
publication.
By
partnering
with
us
they
are
sending
us
press
releases
so
that
we
may
accurately
report
on
newsworthy
content.
unite.ai
employees
are
not
restricted
from
owning
any
equity
in
the
companies
that

profiled.
Nonetheless,
they
are
restricted
from
giving
preferential
treatment
to
any
company
that
they
have
equity

These
guidelines
are
reviewed
and
updated
regularly.

Diversity
Policy 
We
believe
everyone

be
given
equal
opportunity
regardless

orientation,

race.
We
hire

on
multiple

Anonymity
and
Confidential
Sources 
We
believe
the
public
is
best
served
when
we
identify
news
sources
by
their
full
names.
We
aim
to
press
sources
to
place
information
on
the
record
and
seek
independently
to
corroborate
any
information
which
is
deemed
off
the
record.
We
believe
there
are
times
when
anonymity
is
required
in
order
to
safeguard
a
source
and
under
these
circumstances,
we
may
accept
information
from
anonymous
sources
if
we
are
able
to
verify
this
information.
News
and
Opinions
We
draw
a
clear
line
between
what
is
deemed
news
and
opinion
pieces.
We
will
clearly
label
any
article
which
is
considered
an
opinion
piece
with
the
text
‘Opinion’
in
the
title.
Accuracy
and
Corrections
Policy
To
make
errors
is
human
but
we
always
attempt
to
publish
correct
information
based
on
the
data
that
we
have
available.
When
mistakes
or
omissions
happen,
we
will
aim
to
correct
the
error
or
omission
as
soon
as
possible.

you
need
to
inform
us

an
error,
