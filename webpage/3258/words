AI

Source:
NVIDIA
Best-in-class
companies
are
data-driven
with
insights
that
are
increasingly
AI-powered.
Effectively
competing
in
this
new
world
requires
application
modernization
and
AI
adoption.
Neither
task
is
easy.
Organizations
spend
too
much
time
designing
and
maintaining
the
infrastructure
to
support
applications
and
AI.
Companies
need
to
spend
more
time
creating
new
employee
workflows,
products
and
customer
experiences
to
succeed
in
a
highly
competitive
environment.
Technology
vendors
play
a
crucial
role
in
helping
or
hindering
organizational
transformation.
Last
year,
NVIDIA
and
VMware
discussed
how
they
were
creating
an
AI-Ready
Enterprise
platform.
This
month
NVIDIA
and
VMware
announced
the
platform
has
entered
general
availability.
As
part
of
the
partnership:
NVIDIA
extended
its
NVIDIA-certified
program
to
vSphere
infrastructure
.
NVIDIA
spent
more
than
a
year
working
with
numerous
OEMs
to
certify
bare-metal
servers
through
a
program
called
NVIDIA-certified.
A
bare-metal
server
is
your
traditional
dedicated
server
where
only
one
company
uses
it.&nbsp;Bare-metal
supports
multiple
types
of
operating
systems
on
top
of
it
and
can
run
hypervisors.&nbsp;The
goal
behind
the
NVIDIA-certified
program
is
to
simplify
the
process
of
discovering
what
infrastructure
enterprises
should
buy
to
run
AI
in
their
data
centers.
The
company
worked
with
VMWare
to
optimize
NVIDIA
technology
with
vSphere
infrastructure
as
part
of
an
update
to
VMware's
core
virtual
machine
software.
There
is
also
a
fully
integrated
Kubernetes
native
support.
&nbsp;
NVIDIA
shared
an
update
on
the
suite
of
software
to
help
fast-track
enterprise
AI
efforts.
&nbsp;&nbsp;The
software
provides
toolkits
help
with
the
adoption
of
AI
and
simplifies
scaling
AI
models
in
production.&nbsp;The&nbsp;AI
software
suite
includes
NVIDIA's
transfer
learning
toolkit
that
allows
enterprises
to
take
pre-trained
models,
add
a
smaller
set
of
data
that
they
collect
in
their
data
centers,
and
train
against
the
data
they
have.
Using
transfer
learning,
organizations
can
achieve
a
highly
accurate
model
with
a
smaller
data
set
and
use
the
NVIDIA
tools
and
models
in
early
pilots
and
production
use
cases.&nbsp;
The
companies
delivered
optimizations
that
create
performance
improvement
for
virtualized
environments.
In
the
past,
organizations
ran
bare-metal
servers
to
ensure
the
best
performance
and
eliminate
crosstalk
from
other
companies
that
could
happen
in
a
shared,
virtualized
server
environment.
While
performance
was
good,
it
came
at
the
cost
of
efficiency.
Meanwhile,
there
was
also
a
question
as
to
whether
a
virtualized
environment
could
deliver
the
right
performance.
NVIDIA
and
VMware
said
the
newly
optimized
stack
allows
them
to
provide
indistinguishable
performance
from
bare-metal
as
you
scale
up
to
multi-node
infrastructure.&nbsp;VMWare
said
it
achieved
a
20x
performance
improvement
using&nbsp;the
A100
Ampere
GPUs.

Why
does
it
matter?&nbsp;
A
set
of
predefined
solutions,
like
what
NVIDIA
and
VMware
offered,
simplify
infrastructure
purchases
by
helping
IT
leaders
understand
what
products
work
together
and
what
combination
of
components
need
to
be
purchased
to
run
AI
in
their
data
centers.
Everyone
knows
AI
talent
commands
a
premium.
Rather
than
hiring
specific
talent
to
deploy
and
support
AI-specific
infrastructure,
a
certified
solution
allows
companies
to
manage
systems
with
existing
core
IT
teams.&nbsp;

And

Strategy
To
Return
Intel
To
Growth
The
software
stack
provides
foundational
elements
that
help
companies
bootstrap
efforts.
For
example,
an
organization
can
use
its
data
with
NVIDIA
pre-trained
AI
vision
models
and
transfer
learning
to
compress
its
training
cycle
down
to
approximately
eight
weeks.&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the
past,
this
process
could
have
taken
up
to
80
weeks
as
an
organization
installed
new
infrastructure,
hired
new
AI
research
talent,
and
created
its
deep
learning
model.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Additionally,
a
multiple
instance
GPU
infrastructure
provides
new
levels
of
AI
workload
flexibility
for
VMware
customers.
NVIDIA
announced
a
new
architecture
called
the
A100
that
offers
a
multi-instance
GPU
last
May.
The
NVIDIA-VMware
solution
fully
exposes
the
A100
multi-instance
GPU
functionality
to
the
vCenter
control
plane.
The
solution
enables
an
organization
to
have
seven
virtual
machines
(VMs)
share
one
piece
of
hardware
in
a
secure
and
isolated
way
with
guaranteed
quality
of
service
and
response.
It
also
offers
the
ability
for
the
company
to
reaggregate
the
infrastructure
into
one
big
GPU
for
training
performance.&nbsp;
Let's
look
at
what
that
means
in
action.
For
example,
a
financial
firm
running
production
AI
models
for
credit
card
fraud
detection
could
use
a
multi-instance
GPU
to
scale
inferencing
to
meet
peak
demand.
During
the
evening,
when
the
demand
drops,
the
company
can
re-aggregate
the
multiple
multi-instance
GPU
instances
into
a
single
GPU
to
run
AI
model
training
workloads
at
night.
Effectively,
it
allows
a
company
to
use
the
same
infrastructure
for
training
and
inference
by
changing
the
profile
of
how
it
uses
the
GPU
throughout
the
day.
Overall,
it's
clear
that
AI
will
transform
every
industry
and
we're
just
at
the
beginning
of
integrating
this
insight
into
enterprise
applications.
Companies
need
technology
solutions
that
can
speed
the
pace
of
deployment,
help
IT
leaders
add
new
insights
into
applications
and
create
new
products.
It's
good
to
see
new
products
and
collaborations
coming
to
market
to
support
this.
