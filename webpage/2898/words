A
balance
transfer
card
can
be
a
powerful
tool
in
your
debt-busting
arsenal.
By
taking
advantage
of
a
0%
APR
offer
on
a
credit
card,
you
can
save
money
by
having
all
of
your
payments
go
towards
knocking
out
the
principal
balance
instead
of
some
being
siphoned
away
to
pay
the
interest
charges
incurred
from
carrying
a
balance.
Although
taking
a
breather
from
high-interest
debt
is
a
smart
money
move,
you
should
also
do
your
due
diligence
to
choose
the
balance
transfer
card
that
will
help
you
save
the
most
money
overall.
Most
balance
transfer
cards
charge
a
balance
transfer
fee,
typically
3%
to
5%
of
the
amount
being
transferred.
Calculate
the
amount
you’re
looking
to
transfer
plus
any
balance
transfer
fees,
along
with
how
many
months
you’ll
need
to
pay
off
the
debt
to
find
the
balance
transfer
card
that
makes
the
most
sense
for
your
particular
circumstances.
Here
are
Forbes
Advisor’s

picks
for

N/A
Methodology
To
find
the
best
credit
cards
for
balance
transfers
we
looked
across
the
spectrum
of
cards
with
0%
APR
offers
on
shifting
debt.
Then,
we
selected
the
best
cards
for
individual
categories
such
as
lack
of
penalty
fees,
length
of
the
promotional
period
and
no
cost
to
carry
the
card.
The
best
cards
were
chosen
based
on
what
made
them
stand
out
from
the
pack.
That
said,
what
is
best
for
the
majority
of
people
might
not
be
right
for
you.
Do
your
research
before
deciding
which
cards
will
best
help
you
achieve
your
balance
transfer
goals.

If

the
Navy
Federal

Frequently
Asked
Questions
What
Is
A
Balance
Transfer?
A
balance
transfer
lets
you
save
on
existing
high-interest
debt
by
transferring
your
balance
to
a
card
with
a
lower
interest
rate
or
one
with
a
0%
APR
offer
on
balance
transfers.
Sometimes,
there
is
a
balance
transfer
fee
to
move
debt
from
one
card
to
another,
typically
between
3%
to
5%
of
the
amount
being
transferred.
This
fee
will
add
on
to
your
debt
load,
so
do
the
math
before
deciding
to
transfer
your
debt
to
another
card.
If
the
amount
you’re
paying
in
balance
transfer
fees
is
greater
than
what
you’d
save
on
interest
by
doing
the
transfer,
then
it’s
probably
not
a
good
money
move.
How
Long
Do
Balance
Transfers
Take?
It
typically
takes
anywhere
from
two
to
seven
days
for
your
transfer
request
to
be
completed,
but
it
depends
on
the
issuer
of
the
card
you’re
seeking
to
transfer
a
balance
to.
For
example,
American
Express
says
it
typically
takes
from
five
to
seven
days
for
a
transfer
from
another
bank
to
be
completed
but
it
could
take
as
long
as
six
weeks.
Citibank
says
on
its
site
it
can
take
from
two
to
21
days
and
Chase
says
most
transfers
are
complete
within
two
weeks.
The
exact
time
for
your
transfer
will
likely
depend
on
both
the
bank
you’re
transferring
the
debt
to
and
the
bank
you’re
transferring
the
debt
from.
How
Does
A
Balance
Transfer
Card
Work?
The
main
goal
of
a
balance
transfer
is
to
save
money
on
existing
debt.
A
balance
transfer
card
can
save
money
by
allowing
you
to
transfer
your
debt
to
a
new
credit
card
ideally
with
a
lower
rate.
Once
you’ve
transferred
the
debt,
you’ll
make
payments
to
the
new
card.
Ideally,
you
wouldn’t
charge
anything
to
your
new
balance
transfer
card
so
you
can
focus
on
paying
down
the
balance.
Since
most
(but
not
all)
credit
cards
come
with
balance
transfer
fees,
it
typically
only
makes
sense
to
make
this
move
if
the
new
card
has
a
lower
interest
rate
than
your
existing
debt
or
comes
with
a
low
promotional
offer
on
the
new
card.
How
Do
You
Transfer
A
Balance
From
One
Credit
Card
To
Another?
First,
choose
the
card
you
want
to
transfer
a
balance
to.
If
you’re
applying
for
a
new
balance
transfer
card
online,
you’ll
have
the
option
to
choose
to
transfer
a
balance
to
the
new
card
during
the
application
process.
Otherwise,
you
can
speak
to
an
agent
at
the
issuing
bank
for
your
new
card
to
make
the
transfer.
Be
sure
to
read
the
card’s
fine
print
and
understand
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
card
you’re
transferring
a
balance
to.
Things
to
look
for
include:
Is
there
a
balance
transfer
fee?
How
long
are
the
terms
of
any
introductory
low
or
zero-APR
offer?
What’s
the
card’s
ongoing
interest
rate
after
the
intro
period
expires?
Be
aware
that
you
won’t
actually
find
out
how
much
of
a
credit
limit
you’ll
have
on
the
new
card
until
after
you
apply.
This
is
important
because
you
may
not
get
approved
for
a
line
of
credit
as
large
as
the
amount
you’re
looking
to
transfer.
Does
A
Balance
Transfer
Affect
Your
Credit
Score
A
balance
transfer
can
affect
your
credit
score
for
two
reasons.
First,
if
you’re
applying
for
a
new
card
to
transfer
a
balance
to,
the
credit
report
an
issuer
pulls
to
determine
whether
or
not
to
approve
you
can
hurt
your
score
.
Additionally,
if
you’re
approved
for
the
card
and
transfer
an
amount
equal
to
the
maximum
credit
limit
on
the
new
card,
it
will
have
an
adverse
effect
on
your
overall
debt-to-available-credit
ratio,
or
credit
utilization
.
In
other
words,
if
you
max
out
the
new
card
by
doing
a
balance
transfer,
that
isn’t
good
for
your
score
either.
How
Many
Times
Can
You
Balance
Transfer
From
The
Same
Card?
The
number
of
times
you
can
transfer
a
balance
from
the
same
card
will
depend
on
both
the
offer
on
the
card
and
how
much
of
a
credit
limit
you
have.
Most
introductory
balance
transfer
offers
have
a
set
period
of
time
where
you
can
make
a
balance
transfer.
For
example,
if
the
card
says
it
comes
with
a
0%
APR
offer
on
balance
transfers
made
within
45
days
of
opening
the
account,
you
can
make
as
many
transfers
as
you
like
within
45
days,
although
you
will
likely
have
to
pay
a
balance
transfer
fee
each
time
you
do
so.
You
also
may
bump
up
against
your
credit
limit
on
the
card,
which
would
prevent
you
from
making
any
more
transfers.
Who
Can
Qualify
For
A
Balance
Transfer
Card?
Balance
transfer
offers
are
typically
reserved
for
those
with
good
to
excellent
credit.
There
is
a
small
handful
of
cards
with
low
interest
offers
available
to
those
with
fair
credit,
although
these
are
typically
through
credit
unions
which
have
different
underwriting
criteria
then
traditional
banks.
If
you’re
denied
for
a
balance
transfer
card
and
thought
your
credit
was
strong
enough
to
get
approved,
there
are
steps
you
can
take,
including
working
on
improving
your
credit
.
What
Should
I
Look
For
In
A
Balance
Transfer
Card?
Ideally,
you’ll
search
for
a
balance
transfer
card
with
low
or
no
balance
transfer
fees
to
minimize
the
cost
when
you
do
a
transfer.
Also,
you’ll
need
to
choose
a
bank
other
than
the
one
you’re
looking
to
transfer
debt
from
since
banks
won’t
let
you
transfer
debt
from
one
of
their
cards
to
another.
Finally,
consider
the
length
of
your
balance
transfer.
The
longer
it
is,
the
more
time
you’ll
have
to
pay
off
your
debt
before
interest
piles
up.
Is
There
A
Limit
To
How
Much
You
Can
Transfer?
Yes,
but
the
limit
is
determined
by
the
issuing
bank
and
your
creditworthiness.
For
example,
Chase
caps
balance
transfers
at
$15,000
within
a
30-day
limit.
But
there’s
no
guarantee
on
any
card
that
you’ll
get
approved
for
a
limit
on
a
new
card
that
high.
If
you’re
only
approved
for,
say,
a
$5,000
limit
on
a
balance
transfer
card
with
any
bank,
then
$5,000
is
going
to
be
the
maximum
amount
of
debt
you
can
carry
on
the
new
card.
Also
remember
that
any
balance
transfer
fees
will
count
as
your
limit
and
have
to
be
factored
in
when
doing
a
transfer.
So,
if
you’re
approved
for
a
$5,000
credit
limit
but
there’s
a
5%
balance
transfer
fee,
you’ll
only
be
able
to
transfer
$4,750,
since
you’ll
have
to
include
a
$237.50
balance
transfer
fee.
