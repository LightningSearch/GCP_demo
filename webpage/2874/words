on
the
policy.
Read
more
about
term
life
insurance
and
learn
how
to
decide
if
it’s
right
for
you.
How
much
life
insurance
do
I
need?
There
are
a
few
ways
to
calculate
how
much
life
insurance
you
need
,
but
generally
you
want
to
add
up
the
amounts
your
family
will
need
(for
income
replacement,
to
cover
large
debts
and
other
obligations)
and
subtract
the
resources
they
will
already
have
(such
as
savings).
What
is
whole
life
insurance?
Whole
life
insurance
is
an
insurance
policy
that
provides
a
payout
to
beneficiaries
no
matter
when
you
pass
away.
Whole
life
policies
have
a
guaranteed
cash
value
and
are
more
expensive
than
term
life.

to
learn

coverage
makes
most
sense
for
you
.
What
is
universal
life
insurance?
Universal
life
insurance
can
cover
you
for
the
duration
of
your
life.
You
can
tie
the
policy’s
cash
value
to
investment
vehicles,
with
some
varieties.
Premium
payments
and
the
death
benefit
may
be
flexible
with
some
types
of
policies.
How
does
term
life
insurance
work?
Term
life
insurance
covers
you
for
a
set
period
of
time
,
but
if
you
outlive
a
term
life
policy
there’s
no
payout.
Term
life
does
not
offer
a
cash
value,
but
it
is
less
expensive
than
whole
life
insurance.
