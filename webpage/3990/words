As
this
year
shapes
up,
more
digital
disruptors
are
poised
to
change
the
financial
services
landscape.
In
APAC
region,
we
are
seeing
digital-first
organizations
harnessing
the
power
of
data
to
provide
enhanced
customer
experiences
to
give
them
a
competitive
edge
and
deliver
timely,
relevant
offerings
to
their
customers.
Customer
Experience
(CX)
will
become
the
currency
of
financial
services
organizations
in
the
future
and
help
determine
how
products
are
developed
for
an
increasingly
informed
customer.
Join
the
webinar
to
hear
our
expert
panel
talk
through
their
experiences
and
insights
on
these
key
themes:
How
to
fuel
continuous
innovation
across
divisions
and
teams
Building
data
driven
initiatives
within
financial
services
organisations
How
organisations
are
working
