difficult,
more

ones
(or
else
doing
things
we
enjoy
rather
than
things
we

How
To
Speak
Like
A
Leader
In
A
Remote
World
We’re
now
in
a
world
where
more
people
work
remotely
than
ever
before.
At
best,
some
organizations
can
manage
agile
working,
but
the
overriding
situation
is
that
we
interact
face-to-face
less
than
ever
in
our
working
day.
So
how
do
we
lead
this
new
landscape?
And
what
do
we
say?
