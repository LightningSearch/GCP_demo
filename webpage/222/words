İşbank’s
Virtual
Assistant
Maxi
Has
Responded
to
More
Than
1
Million
Customer
Inquiries
Related
To
COVID-19
Turkey’s
largest
private
bank
İşbank
’s
virtual
assistant
Maxi,
available
on
mobile
banking
and
payment
apps
İşCep
and
Maximum
Mobil,
developed
with
conversational
AI
technology
leader
Clinc
,
has
answered
more
than
1
million
customer
questions
related
to
COVID-19
in
a
one
month
period,
which
represents
a
62%
increase
in
usage.
Maxi’s
well-polished
conversational
skills,
rooted
in
Clinc’s
Natural
Language
Processing
(NLP),
deep
learning
and
AI
technologies,
is
crucial
to
İşbank’s
ability
to
deliver
a
personalized
experience
that
keeps
customers
informed
about
their
finances
and
calm
during
these
unsettling
times.&nbsp;
İşbank
has
more
than
8.2
million
mobile
banking
customers
and
5.7
million
of
them
have
used
Maxi.
Maxi
offers
İşbank
customers
a
voice-activated,
intelligent
personal
assistant
in
native
Turkish
that
can
answer
financial
questions
unique
to
each
individual
user;
offering
personalized
spending
advice
and
fulfilling
any
transactional
banking
task.
Because
of
Clinc’s
sophisticated
technology
that
identifies
and
analyzes
dozens
of
factors
like
speech
patterns,
word
structure
and
sentiment,
Maxi
can
understand,
remember
and
respond
to
unconstrained,
contextual,
messy
language,
more
closely
emulating
a
human
interaction.&nbsp;
As
COVID-19
became
a
life-threatening
pandemic
in
Turkey,
İşbank
proactively
took
many
precautions
by
prioritizing
both
customers
and
its
employee’s
health.
After
less
than
a
week
of
training,
Maxi
could
answer
queries
related
to
items
like
COVID-19’s
impact
on
credit
card
debt
and
loan
debt
postponement,
and
successfully
managed
the
increased
query
load
with
no
slowdown.
The
Clinc
AI
platform
enabled
Maxi’s
unprecedentedly
fast
time
to
market
with
new
COVID-19
competencies,
especially
for
a
virtual
assistant
in
a
different
language.
More
than
235,000
customers
asked
Maxi
more
than
1
million
COVID-19
related
questions
–
representing
22%
of
all
queries
Maxi
received
during
this
period,
making
Maxi
an
important
alternative
to
face-to-face
customer
communications.&nbsp;
“Every
moment
in
a
customer’s
journey
matters,
and
our
ability
to
serve
our
customers
at
the
right
time
and
at
the
right
place
with
a
meaningful,
informative
experience
is
of
utmost
importance—especially
during
the
COVID-19
pandemic
as
people
increasingly
check
on
their
finances.
Because
we
had
Maxi
already
deployed,
we
were
in
the
fortunate
position
to
respond
to
pandemic-related
inquiries
extremely
quickly
and
provide
our
customers
with
the
peace
of
mind
they
need,”
said
Halim
Memiş,
Channel
Strategy
Unit
Manager
at
Digital
Banking,
İşbank.
“Maxi
has
also
been
a
tremendous
source
of
relief
for
our
call
center,
which
has
seen
an
increase
in
traffic
over
the
past
month.
We
were
able
to
act
quickly
and
provide
customers
with
the
experience
they
expect
from
us
because
of
Clinc’s
powerful
conversational
AI
technology.”
Clinc
is
the
world
leader
in
conversational
AI
research
and
its
application
for
the
enterprise.
Clinc
enables
brands
like
İşbank
to
have
more
effective
conversations
with
their
customers
than
ever
before,
taking
one
big
step
forward
in
creating
a
truly
frictionless
customer
experience.
The
Clinc
AI
Platform,
which
Maxi
is
built
upon,
is
a
next-generation,
end-to-end
conversational
AI
solution
enabling
organizations
to
build
remarkable
AI,
deploy
it
to
real
users
and
monitor
its
success.&nbsp;
“Clinc’s
conversational
AI
can
relieve
the
immense
pressure
that
has
been
put
on
customer
success
teams
because
of
COVID-19.
By
letting
technology
handle
more
preliminary
inquiries,
customer
support
personnel
can
spend
their
time
on
more
advanced
requests
that
demand
person-to-person
communications.
With
this
division
of
labor,
customers
receive
the
support
they
need
during
this
stressful
time,”
said
Dr.
Johann
Hauswald,
Chief
Customer
Officer
and
Co-Founder,
Clinc.
“What
İşbank
is
doing
with
Maxi
is
a
truly
revolutionary
step
in
virtual
assistant
technology.
I
predict
other
banking
leaders
will
follow
suit
and
use
this
time
to
reevaluate
their
current
continuity
plans
to
integrate
AI
tools
to
keep
customers
connected
–
even
from
a
distance
–
without
any
sacrifices
to
the
quality
of
service.”
