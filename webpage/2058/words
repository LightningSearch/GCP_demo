The
Israeli
startup
company
DataGen
has
recently
raised
$18.5
million
dollars
to
fund
the
creation
of
a
platform
dedicated
to
producing
synthetic
data
for
AI
companies.
Any
artificial
intelligence
company
faces
the
same
core
challenge,
collecting
the
data
necessary
to
train
its
AI
models.
The
need
for
high-quality
training
data
is
so
great
that
it
has
lead
to
an
entire
sub-industry
dedicated
to
providing
AI
companies
with
the
data
they
need
to
train
their
models.
AI
and
AI-adjacent
companies
are
always
looking
for
new
ways
to
get
the
data
they
need.
One
way
to
get
this
training
data
is
to
just
fabricate
or
generate
the
data.
As
Fortune
reported,
DataGen
specializes
in
using
their
own
machine
learning
models
to
create
synthetic
data
for
other
companies
to
train
their
models,
particularly
image
and
video
data.
The
data
generated
by
the
company
is
then
utilized
by
their
customers
to
train
their
own
AI
models.
According
to
DataGen’s
CEO
and
founder,
Ofir
Chakon,
the
company
can
create
an
entirety
synthetic
dataset
for
a
client
company
in
just
a
few
hours.
This
is
substantially
faster
than
the
length
of
time
it
typically
takes
to
prepare
a
dataset
for
use,
which
is
often
weeks
or
even
months
of
labeling
data.
There
are
other
reasons
that
synthetic
data
is
attractive
to
companies,
aside
from
the
relative
speed
with
which
it
can
be
prepared.
Synthetic
data
doesn’t
come
with
the
kinds
of
privacy
concerns
that
real
data
does.
As
more
laws
are
created
to
protect
people’s
data
privacy,
it
becomes
more
attractive
to
have
synthetic
training
data.
One
estimate
given
by
the
technology
analytics
firm
Gartner
predicts
that
by
2023
around
65%
of
the
world’s
population
will
have
their
data
protected
by
some
type
of
data
privacy
law.
Despite
the
fact
that
synthetic
data
isn’t
based
on
real
people,
it
can
still
be
biased.
The
data
generated
by
a
synthetic
data
model
will
have
the
same
patterns
the
original
training
data
had,
meaning
that
if
a
dataset
is
biased
those
biases
will
exist
in
the
newly
generated
data.
DataGen
has
strategies
for
reducing
data
bias
in
the
generated
data.
One
method
for
reducing
bias
in
synthetic
data
is
increasing
the
occurrence
rate
of
relatively
rare
events,
meaning
that
if
one
class
in
the
dataset
is
under-represented
its
occurrence
rate
can
be
boosted
up
to
something
more
equal.
The
technique
of
boosting
the
occurrence
of
rare
events
is
incredibly
important
when
creating
datasets
that
involve
potentially
dangerous
scenarios.
Consider
a
dataset
used
to
train
an
autonomous
vehicle.
The
vehicle
must
reliably
respond
to
rare
events,
such
as
a
sinkhole
opening
up
in
the
road.
However,
these
events
are
very
rare,
and
getting
training
data
for
these
events
is
difficult.
For
this
reason,
training
data
for
these
rare
events
often
need
to
be
generated.
As
Chakon
explained
via
Fortune:
&#8220;Our
customers
have
full
control
over
all
the
parameters
that
go
into
the
data
they
create.
The
real-world
implication
is
that,
once
deployed,
you
can
be
sure
it&#8217;s
going
to
work
well
in
different
domains,
with
different
ethnicities,
in
different
geographic
locations
or
any
environment
you
can
imagine.&#8221;
DataGen
uses
Generative
Adversarial
Networks
(GANs)
to
generate
realistic
simulations
of
real-world
items
and
events.
Chakon
explained
that
the
company
can
reliably
generate
realistic
examples
of
anything
that
involves
indoor
environments
or
human
perception.
For
instance,
an
image
dataset
generated
by
DataGen
could
include
examples
of
objects
used
to
train
a
robotic
picking
arm
used
for
warehouse
logistics,
with
the
generated
images
looking
indistinguishable
from
the
real
thing.
DataGen’s
software
can
generate
3D
objects
by
combining
a
visual
meshwork
with
a
physics
simulation
system.
Investors
in
DataGen
include
a
variety
of
high-profile
individuals
and
companies.
Investors
include
the
directors
of
Nvidia’s
AI
research
division
and
the
Max
Plank
Institute
for
Intelligent
Systems,
as
well
as
Anthony
Goldbloom,
CEO
of
Kaggle.
