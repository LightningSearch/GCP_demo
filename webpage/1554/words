What
is
Computer
Vision?
Computer
vision
algorithms
are
one
of
the
most
transformative
and
powerful
AI
systems
in
the
world,
at
the
moment.
Computer
vision
systems
see
use
in
autonomous
vehicles,
robot
navigation,
facial
recognition
systems,
and
more.
However,
what
are
computer
vision
algorithms
exactly?
How
do
they
work?
In
order
to
answer
these
questions,
we’ll
dive
deep
into
the
theory
behind
computer
vision,
computer
vision
algorithms,
and
applications
for
computer
vision
systems.
How
Do
Computer
Vision
Systems
Work?
In
order
to
fully
appreciate
how
computer
vision
systems
work,
let’s
first
take
a
moment
to
discuss
how
humans
recognize
objects.
The
best
explanation
neuropsychology
has
for
how
we
recognize
objects
is
a
model
that
describes
the
initial
phase
of
object
recognition
as
one
where
the
basic
components
of
objects,
such
as
form,
color,
and
depth
are
interpreted
by
the
brain
first.
The
signals
from
the
eye
that
enter
the
brain
are
analyzed
to
pull
out
the
edges
of
an
object
first
,
and
these
edges
are
joined
together
into
a
more
complex
representation
that
complete’s
the
object’s
form.
Computer
vision
systems
operate
very
similarly
to
the
human
visual
system,
by
first
discerning
the
edges
of
an
object
and
then
joining
these
edges
together
into
the
object’s
form.
The
big
difference
is
that
because
computers
interpret
images
as
numbers,
a
computer
vision
system
needs
some
way
to
interpret
the
individual
pixels
that
comprise
the
image.
The
computer
vision
system
will
assign
values
to
the
pixels
in
the
image
and
by
examining
the
difference
in
values
between
one
region
of
pixels
and
another
region
of
pixels,
the
computer
can
discern
edges.
For
instance,
if
the
image
in
question
is
greyscale,
then
the
values
will
range
from
black
(represented
by
0)
to
white
(represented
by
255).
A
sudden
change
in
the
range
of
values
of
pixels
near
each
other
will
indicate
an
edge.
This
basic
principle
of
comparing
pixel
values
can
also
be
done
with
colored
images,
with
the
computer
comparing
differences
between
the
different
RGB
color
channels.
So
know
that
we
know
how
a
computer
vision
system
examines
pixel
values
to
interpret
an
image,
let’s
take
a
look
at
the
architecture
of
a
computer
vision
system.
Convolutional
Neural
Networks
(CNNs)
The
primary
type
of
AI
used
in
computer
vision
tasks
is
one
based
on
convolutional
neural
networks
.
What’s
a
convolution
exactly?
Convolutions
are
mathematical
processes
the
network
uses
to
determine
the
difference
in
values
between
pixels.
If
you
envision
a
grid
of
pixel
values,
picture
a
smaller
grid
being
moved
over
this
main
grid.
The
values
underneath
the
second
grid
are
being
analyzed
by
the
network,
so
the
network
is
only
examining
a
handful
of
pixels
at
a
time.
This
is
often
called
the
“sliding
windows”
technique.
The
values
being
analyzed
by
the
sliding
window
are
summarized
by
the
network,
which
helps
reduce
the
complexity
of
the
image
and
make
it
easier
for
the
network
to
extract
patterns.
Convolutional
neural
networks
are
divided
into
two
different
sections
,
the
convolutional
section
and
the
fully
connected
section.
The
convolutional
layers
of
the
network
are
the
feature
extractors,
whose
job
is
to
analyze
the
pixels
within
the
image
and
form
representations
of
them
that
the
densely
connected
layers
of
the
neural
network
can
learn
patterns
from.
The
convolutional
layers
start
by
just
examining
the
pixels
and
extracting
the
low-level
features
of
the
image
like
edges.
Later
convolutional
layers
join
the
edges
together
into
more
complex
shapes.
By
the
end,
the
network
will
hopefully
have
a
representation
of
the
edges
and
details
of
the
image
that
it
can
pass
to
the
fully
connected
layers.
Image
Annotation
While
a
convolutional
neural
network
can
extract
patterns
from
images
by
itself,
the
accuracy
of
the
computer
vision
system
can
be
greatly
improved
by
annotating
the
images.
Image
annotation
is
the
process
of
adding
metadata
to
the
image
that
assists
the
classifier
in
detecting
important
objects
in
the
image.
The
use
of
image
annotation
is
important
whenever
computer
vision
systems
need
to
be
highly
accurate,
such
as
when
controlling
an
autonomous
vehicle
or
robot.
There
are
various
ways
that
images
can
be
annotated
to
improve
the
performance
of
a
computer
vision
classifier.
Image
annotation
is
often
done
with
bounding
boxes,
a
box
that
surrounds
the
edges
of
the
target
object
and
tells
the
computer
to
focus
its
attention
within
the
box.
Semantic
segmentation
is
another
type
of
image
annotation,
which
operates
by
assigning
an
image
class
to
every
pixel
in
an
image.
In
other
words,
every
pixel
that
could
be
considered
“grass”
or
“trees”
will
be
labeled
as
belonging
to
those
classes.
The
technique
provides
pixel-level
precision,
but
creating
semantic
segmentation
annotations
is
more
complex
and
time-consuming
than
creating
simple
bounding
boxes.
Other
annotation
methods,
like
lines
and
points,
also
exist.
