If
you’ve
been
learning
about
data
science
or
machine
learning
,
there’s
a
good
chance
you’ve
heard
the
term
“Bayes
Theorem”
before,
or
a
“Bayes
classifier”.
These
concepts
can
be
somewhat
confusing,
especially
if
you
aren’t
used
to
thinking
of
probability
from
a
traditional,
frequentist
statistics
perspective.
This
article
will
attempt
to
explain
the
principles
behind
Bayes
Theorem
and
how
it&#8217;s
used
in
machine
learning.
What
is
Bayes
Theorem?
Bayes
Theorem
is
a
method
of
calculating
conditional
probability
.
The
traditional
method
of
calculating
conditional
probability
(the
probability
that
one
event
occurs
given
the
occurrence
of
a
different
event)
is
to
use
the
conditional
probability
formula,
calculating
the
joint
probability
of
event
one
and
event
two
occurring
at
the
same
time,
and
then
dividing
it
by
the
probability
of
event
two
occurring.
However,
conditional
probability
can
also
be
calculated
in
a
slightly
different
fashion
by
using
Bayes
Theorem.
When
calculating
conditional
probability
with
Bayes
theorem,
you
use
the
following
steps:
Determine
the
probability
of
condition
B
being
true,
assuming
that
condition
A
is
true.
Determine
the
probability
of
event
A
being
true.
Multiply
the
two
probabilities
together.
Divide
by
the
probability
of
event
B
occurring.
This
means
that
the
formula
for
Bayes
Theorem
could
be
expressed
like
this:
P(A|B)
=
P(B|A)*P(A)
/
P(B)
Calculating
the
conditional
probability
like
this
is
especially
useful
when
the
reverse
conditional
probability
can
be
easily
calculated,
or
when
calculating
the
joint
probability
would
be
too
challenging.
Example
of
Bayes
Theorem
This
might
be
easier
to
interpret
if
we
spend
some
time
looking
at
an
example
of
how
you
would
apply
Bayesian
reasoning
and
Bayes
Theorem.
Let’s
assume
you
were
playing
a
simple
game
where
multiple
participants
tell
you
a
story
and
you
have
to
determine
which
one
of
the
participants
is
lying
to
you.
Let’s
fill
in
the
equation
for
Bayes
Theorem
with
the
variables
in
this
hypothetical
scenario.
We’re
trying
to
predict
whether
each
individual
in
the
game
is
lying
or
telling
the
truth,
so
if
there
are
three
players
apart
from
you,
the
categorical
variables
can
be
expressed
as
A1,
A2,
and
A3.
The
evidence
for
their
lies/truth
is
their
behavior.
Like
when
playing
poker,
you
would
look
for
certain
“tells”
that
a
person
is
lying
and
use
those
as
bits
of
information
to
inform
your
guess.
Or
if
you
were
allowed
to
question
them
it
would
be
any
evidence
their
story
doesn’t
add
up.
We
can
represent
the
evidence
that
a
person
is
lying
as
B.
To
be
clear,
we’re
aiming
to
predict
Probability(A
is
lying/telling
the
truth|given
the
evidence
of
their
behavior).
To
do
this
we’d
want
to
figure
out
the
probability
of
B
given
A,
or
the
probability
that
their
behavior
would
occur
given
the
person
genuinely
lying
or
telling
the
truth.
You’re
trying
to
determine
under
which
conditions
the
behavior
you
are
seeing
would
make
the
most
sense.
If
there
are
three
behaviors
you
are
witnessing,
you
would
do
the
calculation
for
each
behavior.
For
example,
P(B1,
B2,
B3
*
A).
You
would
then
do
this
for
every
occurrence
of
A/for
every
person
in
the
game
aside
from
yourself.
That’s
this
part
of
the
equation
above:
P(B1,
B2,
B3,|A)
*
P|A
Finally,
we
just
divide
that
by
the
probability
of
B.
If
we
received
any
evidence
about
the
actual
probabilities
in
this
equation,
we
would
recreate
our
probability
model,
taking
the
new
evidence
into
account.
This
is
called
updating
your
priors,
as
you
update
your
assumptions
about
the
prior
probability
of
the
observed
events
occurring.
Machine
Learning
Applications
for
Bayes
theorem
The
most
common
use
of
Bayes
theorem
when
it
comes
to
machine
learning
is
in
the
form
of
the
Naive
Bayes
algorithm.
Naive
Bayes
is
used
for
the
classification
of
both
binary
and
multi-class
datasets,
Naive
Bayes
gets
its
name
because
the
values
assigned
to
the
witnesses
evidence/attributes
&#8211;
Bs
in
P(B1,
B2,
B3
*
A)
&#8211;
are
assumed
to
be
independent
of
one
another.
It’s
assumed
that
these
attributes
don’t
impact
each
other
in
order
to
simplify
the
model
and
make
calculations
possible,
instead
of
attempting
the
complex
task
of
calculating
the
relationships
between
each
of
the
attributes.
Despite
this
simplified
model,
Naive
Bayes
tends
to
perform
quite
well
as
a
classification
algorithm,
even
when
this
assumption
probably
isn’t
true
(which
is
most
of
the
time).
There
are
also
commonly
used
variants
of
the
Naive
Bayes
classifier
such
as
Multinomial
Naive
Bayes,
Bernoulli
Naive
Bayes,
and
Gaussian
Naive
Bayes.
Multinomial
Naive
Bayes
algorithms
are
often
used
to
classify
documents,
as
it
is
effective
at
interpreting
the
frequency
of
words
within
a
document.
Bernoulli
Naive
Bayes
operates
similarly
to
Multinomial
Naive
Bayes,
but
the
predictions
rendered
by
the
algorithm
are
booleans.
This
means
that
when
predicting
a
class
the
values
will
be
binary,
no
or
yes.
In
the
domain
of
text
classification,
a
Bernoulli
Naive
Bayes
algorithm
would
assign
the
parameters
a
yes
or
no
based
on
whether
or
not
a
word
is
found
within
the
text
document.
If
the
value
of
the
predictors/features
aren’t
discrete
but
are
instead
continuous,
Gaussian
Naive
Bayes
can
be
used.
It’s
assumed
that
the
values
the
continuous
features
have
been
sampled
from
a
gaussian
distribution.
