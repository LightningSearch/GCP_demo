The
Old
Guard
And
Fintech
Cozy
Up

As
part
of
the
#FinovateLive
series,
April
Rudin,
Founder
and
CEO
of
The
Rudin
Group
and
global
wealth
marketing
strategist,
explores
the
current
wealth
management
space,
and
why
this
year
the
industry
looks
set
to
merge
closer
with
fintech,
as
incumbent
players
realise
they
need
to
embrace
technology
to
meet
demands
of
younger
generations. 
The
old
guard
wealth
management
industry
and
fintech
have
kept
each
other
at
arm&#8217;s
length
for
years,
claiming
the
other
lacks
the
tools
to
meet
current
client
needs.
But
in
2019,
we
expect
they&#8217;ll
put
past
differences
aside
and
finally
cozy
up
to
each
other.
&#8220;Partnerships&#8221;
will
be
the
buzzword
for
the
new
year
as
incumbent
players
realize
they
must
embrace
tech
to
meet
the 
demands
of
their
millennial
clients
,
while
so-called
fintech
players
realize
sometimes
clients
really
do
want
the
intimacy
of
a
face-to-face
meeting.
As
proof
of
concept,
look
no
further
than
Morgan
Stanley&#8217;s
recently
announced
bid
to
buy
Solium
Capital
in
a
$900
million
all-cash
deal
&#8211;
its
biggest
acquisition
since
the
financial
crisis.
By
snatching
up
the
Canada-based
employee
stock
plan
administrator,
which
counts
Hootsuite
and
Dropbox
among
its
clients, 
Morgan
Stanley
hopes
to
facilitate
a
path
to
draw
millennials
into
its
wealth
management
practice
. 
Solium,
meanwhile,
receives
the
backing
of
one
of
the
largest
banks
in
the
United
States
.
We
expect
to
see
more
of
this
in
2019
&#8211;
whether
it&#8217;s
outright
acquisitions
of
smaller
players
or
strategic
partnerships
between
incumbents
and
fintech
players.
With
the
$30
trillion
generational
wealth
transfer
 in
its
early
innings,
pure-play
robo-advisers
are
finding
that
their
algorithmic
services
aren&#8217;t
enough
to
win
over
millennials
on
the
brink
of
their
asset
accumulation
years.
A
robo-adviser
may
be
sufficient
when
a
plan
is
in
place,
but
fintech
and
artificial
intelligence
(AI)
have
yet
to
replicate
the
insights
gleaned
or
the
comfort
level
achieved
through
one-on-one
conversations.
This
is
especially
true
for
young
families
balancing
student
loan
payments,
first
homes,
and
education
planning
for
young
children.
Even
my
millennial
son
told
me
he
was
frustrated
that
robo-advisers
kept
being
pushed
on
him
when
he
really
wanted
a
human
adviser
to
help
him
navigate
through
the
world
of
investments.
But
it&#8217;s
not
just
the
robo-advisers
that
gain
from
partnering
with
incumbents.
Traditional
wealth
managers
also
benefit
by
having
their
services
buttressed
by
fintech
players.
It&#8217;s
no
longer
an
all-or-nothing
dance
between
the
two:
Incumbents
can
leverage
in-house
technology
to
spend
more
time
forging
meaningful
client
relationships.
What
we&#8217;re
seeing
in
2019
is
that
an
industry
once
known
for
its
left-brained
quantitative
skills
can
now
work
the
right
side
of
its
brain
&#8211;
all
thanks
to
technology,
ironically.
Clients
will
soon
be
benefiting
from
hybrid
advice.
While
algorithms
can
quickly
churn
out
portfolio
options
that
advisers
previously
spent
days
crafting,
advisers
today
can
use
the
time
saved
to
think
more
critically
about
their
recommendations.
Rather
than
prescribing
financial
advice,
they
can
embrace
a
more
holistic
approach
to
determine
what
their
clients
want
and
how
they
feel
about
their
portfolio
and
wealth.
But
the
expected
partnerships
in
the
wealth
management
industry
don&#8217;t
just
apply
to
adviser-client
dynamics.
Total
investable
assets
in
North
America
are
expected
to
grow
by
nearly
10%,
to
$28.8
trillion
by
2021,
according
to
a 
2018
Ernst
&amp;
Young
study
.
And
that
wealth
is
not
just
concentrated
in
a
mix
of
stocks
and
bonds.
The
era&#8217;s
low
interest
rates
have
compelled
households
to
allocate
some
of
their
wealth
to
alternative
asset
classes.
For
this
reason,
advisers
need
to
know
how
to
manage
and
analyze
diverse
holdings.
And
as
the
wealth
management
industry
continues
to
grow
&#8211;
both
in
terms
of
assets
and
clients
from
the
wealth
transfer
&#8211;
it
will
need
to
attract
a
young,
engaged
workforce
to
meet
increasing
and
evolving
demands.
Analog
solutions
won&#8217;t
cut
it
in
a
digitized
world,
especially
when
it
comes
to
luring
talent
away
from
Silicon
Valley.
While
many
firms
previously
relied
on
a
patchwork
of
legacy
systems
to
conduct
business,
today&#8217;s
younger
workforce
wants
clean,
reliable
interfaces
to
complete
their
work.
We
expect
to
see
increased
intergenerational
team
partnerships
in
the
wealth
management
industry.
After
all,
the
&#8220;average&#8221;
adviser
is
55
&#8211;
and
perhaps
thinking
of
their
own
retirement.
We
anticipate
they
will
be
leaning
on
their
younger
staffs
and
calling
on
their
expertise.
While
advisers
may
have
the
years
of
experience,
younger
employees
&#8211;
and
digital
natives
&#8211;
will
know
new
ways
of
reaching
existing
clients
and
prospects.
The
room
for
partnerships
in
2019
extends
throughout
the
wealth
management
pipeline.
From
mergers
between
incumbent
and
fintech
players
to
generationally
diverse
teams
amid
the
wealth
transfer,
it&#8217;s
clear
we&#8217;re
moving
from
conversation
to
commitment.
