C
ontact
centers
are
undergoing
a
rewrite.
No
longer
seen
as
necessary
evils,
they’re
being
recognized
as
nerve
centers
of
the
customer
experience,
solving
customers’
most
immediate
problems
and
managing
their
most
personal
brand
interactions.
What’s
driving
the
transformation?
Changing
customer
expectations
and
a
suite
of
AI-
and
cloud-powered
innovations
ready
to
keep
up.
Voice
calls
still
dominate
customer
service—in
a
survey
of
3,000
consumers
conducted
by
BT
and
Cisco
,
74%
of
respondents
said
they
phoned
a
contact
center
last
year.
But
today’s
customer
also
expects
personalized,
end-to-end
solutions
that
suit
the
moment,
their
device,
even
their
mood.
More
and
more,
interactions
are
held
on
digital
channels,
often
across
multiple
platforms.
In
fact,
according
to
BT
and
Cisco’s
survey,
63%
of
consumers
believe
they
should
be
able
to
switch
between
chat,
voice
and
video
calls
seamlessly.
<fbs-ad

“Contact
centers
are
increasingly
becoming
value
creators,”
says
Dr.
Nicola
Millard,
principal
partner
at
BT.
Keep
reading
for
insights
on
how
modern
contact
centers
can
create
superior,
personalized
experiences
for
both
customers
and
the
agents
who
serve
them,
with
expert
commentary
from
Millard
and
BT’s
Andrew
Small,
managing
director
of
global
portfolio,
and
Riccy
Sidoli,
general
manager
of
customer
relationship
management.

Cutting-edge
contact
centers
don’t
just
answer
questions;
they
understand
customer
behavior
on
a
macro
scale
and
anticipate
customer
needs
on
the
micro.
Largely
responsible
for
these
vital
new
capabilities
are
two
technologies
in
particular:
artificial
intelligence
(AI)
and
cloud-based
computing.

What,
exactly,
do
customers
expect
when
they
contact
a
brand?
“They
want
immediacy,”
says
Small.
“Whether
speech
or
messaging
or
anything
else,
they
want
to
be
able
to
keep
the
conversation
going”
on
the
channel
that
suits
their
needs.
Here
are
four
examples
of
how
AI-
and
cloud-powered
contact
centers
are
making
that
possible:

“Agents
are
critical
in
building
brands—and
they
know
that,”
says
Millard.
Yet
service
agents
face
significant
barriers
to
delivering
their
best
work
and,
therefore,
an
exceptional
brand
experience.
According
to
BT
and
Cisco’s
survey,
roughly
half
of
agents
believe
customers
are
kept
waiting
too
long
(48%);
that
they
spend
too
much
time
trying
to
find
relevant
information
(52%);
and
that
it
takes
too
long
to
identify
and
verify
customers
(46%).
Here’s
how
AI-
and
cloud-driven
innovations
are
improving
agents’
experiences
while
helping
them
close
the
service
delivery
gap:

Especially
for
global
organizations,
each
point
of
contact
with
a
customer
is
an
opportunity
to
create
a
good
impression.
Customer
service,
then,
must
be
seen
as
more
than
putting
out
fires
as
quickly
as
possible;
contact
centers
are
touchpoints
for
brand-building.
“The
opportunity
is
there
to
provide
more
personalized
service
to
your
customers
that
gets
them
more
engaged
and
sticky
with
your
brand,”
says
Sidoli.
That's
effectively
how
the
big
success
stories
have
done
it.”
To
explain
how
an
end-to-end
contact
center
ecosystem
can
support
this,
Sidoli
and
his
colleagues
offer
these
four
takeaways:
