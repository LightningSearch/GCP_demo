What
are
Artificial
Neural
Networks
(ANNs)?
Many
of
the
biggest
advances
in
AI
are
driven
by
artificial
neural
networks
.
Artificial
Neural
Networks
(ANNs)
are
the
connection
of
mathematical
functions
joined
together
in
a
format
inspired
by
the
neural
networks
found
in
the
human
brain.
These
ANNs
are
capable
of
extracting
complex
patterns
from
data,
applying
these
patterns
to
unseen
data
to
classify/recognize
the
data.
In
this
way,
the
machine
“learns”.
That’s
a
quick
rundown
on
neural
networks,
but
let’s
take
a
closer
look
at
neural
networks
to
better
understand
what
they
are
and
how
they
operate.
Multi-layer
Perceptron
Explained
Before
we
look
at
more
complex
neural
networks,
we’re
going
to
take
a
moment
to
look
at
a
simple
version
of
an
ANN,
a
Multi-Layer
Perceptron
(MLP)
.
Imagine
an
assembly
line
at
a
factory.
On
this
assembly
line,
one
worker
receives
an
item,
makes
some
adjustments
to
it,
and
then
passes
it
on
to
the
next
worker
in
the
line
who
does
the
same.
This
process
continues
until
the
last
worker
in
the
line
puts
the
finishing
touches
on
the
item
and
puts
it
on
a
belt
that
will
take
it
out
of
the
factory.
In
this
analogy,
there
are
multiple
“layers”
to
the
assembly
line,
and
products
move
between
layers
as
they
move
from
worker
to
worker.
The
assembly
line
also
has
an
entry
point
and
an
exit
point.
A
Multi-Layer
Perceptron
can
be
thought
of
as
a
very
simple
production
line,
made
out
of
three
layers
total:
an
input
layer,
a
hidden
layer,
and
an
output
layer.
The
input
layer
is
where
the
data
is
fed
into
the
MLP,
and
in
the
hidden
layer
some
number
of
“workers”
handle
the
data
before
passing
it
onto
the
output
layer
which
gives
the
product
to
the
outside
world.
In
the
instance
of
an
MLP,
these
workers
are
called
“neurons”
(or
sometimes
nodes)
and
when
they
handle
the
data
they
manipulate
it
through
a
series
of
mathematical
functions.
Within
the
network,
there
are
structures
connecting
node
to
node
called
“
weights
”.
Weights
are
an
assumption
about
how
data
points
are
related
as
they
move
through
the
network.
To
put
that
another
way,
weights
reflect
the
level
of
influence
that
one
neuron
has
over
another
neuron.
The
weights
pass
through
an
“activation
function”
as
they
leave
the
current
node,
which
is
a
type
of
mathematical
function
that
transforms
the
data.
They
transform
linear
data
into
non-linear
representations,
which
enables
the
network
to
analyze
complex
patterns.
The
analogy
to
the
human
brain
implied
by
“artificial
neural
network”
comes
from
the
fact
that
the
neurons
which
make
up
the
human
brain
are
joined
together
in
a
similar
fashion
to
how
nodes
in
an
ANN
are
linked.
While
multi-layer
perceptrons
have
existed
since
the
1940s,
there
were
a
number
of
limitations
that
prevented
them
from
being
especially
useful.
However,
over
the
course
of
the
past
couple
of
decades,
a
technique
called
“
backpropagation
”
was
created
that
allowed
networks
to
adjust
the
weights
of
the
neurons
and
thereby
learn
much
more
effectively.
Backpropagation
changes
the
weights
in
the
neural
network,
allowing
the
network
to
better
capture
the
actual
patterns
within
the
data.
Deep
Neural
Networks
Deep
neural
networks
take
the
basic
form
of
the
MLP
and
make
it
larger
by
adding
more
hidden
layers
in
the
middle
of
the
model.
So
instead
of
there
being
an
input
layer,
a
hidden
layer,
and
an
output
layer,
there
are
many
hidden
layers
in
the
middle
and
the
outputs
of
one
hidden
layer
become
the
inputs
for
the
next
hidden
layer
until
the
data
has
made
it
all
the
way
through
the
network
and
been
returned.
The
multiple
hidden
layers
of
a
deep
neural
network
are
able
to
interpret
more
complex
patterns
than
the
traditional
multilayer
perceptron.
Different
layers
of
the
deep
neural
network
learn
the
patterns
of
different
parts
of
the
data.
For
instance,
if
the
input
data
consists
of
images,
the
first
portion
of
the
network
might
interpret
the
brightness
or
darkness
of
pixels
while
the
later
layers
will
pick
out
shapes
and
edges
that
can
be
used
to
recognize
objects
in
the
image.
Different
Types
Of
Neural
Networks
There
are
various
types
of
neural
networks,
and
each
of
the
various
neural
network
types
has
its
own
advantages
and
disadvantages
(and
therefore
their
own
use
cases).
The
type
of
deep
neural
network
described
above
is
the
most
common
type
of
neural
network,
and
it
is
often
referred
to
as
a
feedforward
neural
network.
One
variation
on
neural
networks
is
the
Recurrent
Neural
Network
(
RNN
).
In
the
case
of
Recurrent
Neural
Networks
,
looping
mechanisms
are
used
to
hold
information
from
previous
states
of
analysis,
meaning
that
they
can
interpret
data
where
the
order
matters.
RNNs
are
useful
in
deriving
patterns
from
sequential/chronological
data.
Recurrent
Neural
Networks
can
be
either
unidirectional
or
bidirectional.
In
the
case
of
a
bi-directional
neural
network,
the
network
can
take
information
from
later
in
the
sequence
as
well
as
earlier
portions
of
the
sequence.
Since
the
bi-directional
RNN
takes
more
information
into
account,
it’s
better
able
to
draw
the
right
patterns
from
the
data.
A
Convolutional
Neural
Network
is
a
special
type
of
neural
network
that
is
adept
at
interpreting
the
patterns
found
within
images.
A
CNN
operates
by
passing
a
filter
over
the
pixels
of
the
image
and
achieving
a
numerical
representation
of
the
pixels
within
the
image,
which
it
can
then
analyze
for
patterns.
A
CNN
is
structured
so
that
the
convolutional
layers
which
pull
the
pixels
out
of
the
image
come
first,
and
then
the
densely
connected
feed-forward
layers
come,
those
that
will
actually
learn
to
recognize
objects,
come
after
this.
