The
rise
of
remote
work
has
led
to
the
adoption
of
new
workplace
technologies,
with
a
handful
of
startups
vying
to
be
the
next
ADP
or
Workday.&nbsp;
Allan
Jones
has
seen
the
challenges
of
running
a
small
business
firsthand.
When
he
was
14,
his
father
was
sued
for
wrongful
termination
by
a
former
employee
of
his
Compton,
California
mini-market.
Without
the
guidance
of
a
human
resources
department
or
the
finances
to
fight
the
suit,
he
was
forced
to
hire
an
attorney
and
dip
into
Jones’
college
savings
to
pay
the
fees.
<fbs-ad
position="top"
progressive
ad-id="article-0-top">
This
experience
stuck
with
Jones,
and
in
2016
inspired
him
to
found
Bambee
,
a
Los
Angeles-based
company
that
pairs
HR
managers
with
small
and
midsize
businesses
on
a
monthly
basis.
“I
knew
that
small
businesses
did
not
have
HR,
and
the
primary
reason
was
price,”
says
Jones,
34.
“Your
HR
compliance
is
essentially
like
the
health
of
your
business,
just
like
your
general
practitioner.”
For
$99
a
month,
his
thousands
of
business-owner
clients
can
hire
dedicated
HR
managers
to
help
craft
policies,
onboard
and
terminate
employees
and
navigate
the
murky
regulatory
waters
of
being
an
employer—all
through
an
app,
something
that’s
been
critical
in
a
remote
world.
As
businesses
have
had
to
virtually
navigate
HR
complexities
amid
the
pandemic,
startups
like
Bambee,
all
vying
to
be
the
next
ADP
or
Workday,
have
grown
in
popularity.
HR
software
is
projected
to
become
a
$43
billion
industry
by
2026,
according
to
business
analytics
platform
CB
Insights,
and
despite
a
brief
spending
pause
last
April,
companies
have
increased
their
usage
of
these
platforms,
says
Dan
Staley,
PricewaterhouseCoopers'
U.S.
HR
technology
leader.
“If
you
want
to
have
a
good
employee
experience,
which
we
know
can
impact
how
productive
your
workers
are,
that's
where
you
want
to
have
better
automation,”
he
says.
Among
the
startups
riding
this
wave
is
Deel.
Cofounders
Alex
Bouaziz
and
Shuo
Wang
met
while
earning
their
master’s
degrees
at
the
Massachusetts
Institute
Technology
in
2013.
After
graduating
and
launching
startups
in
Israel
and
China,
respectively,
they
realized
they
couldn’t
afford
the
highly
skilled
workers
in
their
pricey
markets
and
started
hiring
from
around
the
world.
It
wasn’t
easy.
“People
looked
at
distributed
teams
with
the
wrong
definition,
which
was
that
it
was
outsourced,”
says
Bouaziz,
who
made
Forbes’
2021
30
Under
30
Finance
list
.
“We
never
thought
about
it
that
way.
It
doesn't
matter
where
you
are,
your
teammates
want
to
give
you
a
great
experience
globally.”
In
2019,
Bouaziz,
27,
and
Wang,
32,
launched
Deel
to
simplify
hiring
and
managing
remote
workers.
For
more
than
1,400
companies—including
Brex,
The
Real
Real
and
Andela—the
San
Francisco-based
startup
acts
as
an
employer
of
record,
saving
them
the
cost
of
creating
a
foreign
entity
and
ensuring
compliance
with
local
labor
laws.
Deel
also
processes
international
contracts,
invoices
and
payroll,
allowing
contractors
and
employees
to
quickly
get
paid
in
their
currencies
of
choice.
Companies
are
billed
$49
a
month
per
contractor,
and
$500
a
month
per
employee
(though
fellow
venture
capital-backed
startups
are
given
a
hefty
discount).
The
widespread
adoption
of
remote
work
has
only
accelerated
the
company’s
growth.
In
May,
Deel
secured
$14
million
in
funding
led
by
Andreessen
Horowitz,
and
in
September,
it
garnered
another
$30
million
in
funding
led
by
Spark
Capital.
With
a
valuation
of
more
than
$200
million,
Bousaziz
says
revenue
grew
20-fold
last
year.
“We
always
knew
that
this
was
eventually
going
to
happen,
but
maybe
it
was
two
or
three
years
away,”
Bouaziz
says.
“But
whether
or
not
people
were
going
to
recognize
that
talent
is
everywhere
is
something
that
was
pretty
obvious
on
our
end,
so
it's
been
more
of
an
acceleration.”
Deel
isn’t
the
only
startup
trying
to
make
global
hiring
easier.
GitLab
veteran
Job
van
der
Voort
and
Marcelo
Lebre
launched
competitor
Remote
in
2019
before
raising
$46
million
in
funding
from
investors
including
Sequoia
Capital
and
General
Catalyst
last
year.
Like
Deel,
Remote
allows
companies
such
as
GitLab
and
Paystack
to
onboard
and
pay
contractors
and
employees
anywhere
in
the
world—all
while
managing
payroll
and
benefits.
“We
feel
very
strongly
about
doing
things
correctly,
staying
compliant
and
making
sure
our
clients
are
compliant,”
says
van
der
Voort,
31.
“We
don't
depend
on
third
parties
for
anything
that
we
do,
so
that
means
that
even
as
far
as
payments,
we
rely
on
our
own
payments
network.”
Remote,
itself,
operates
completely
and
permanently
remote
with
no
company
offices.
But
while
Deel
charges
customers
for
contractors
and
employees,
Remote
allows
companies
to
manage
the
former
for
free
(payment
processing
fees
do
apply).
The
cost
of
managing
global
employees
starts
at
$349
per
month
(or
$299
per
month
if
paying
annually).
Since
Remote
started
signing
on
customers
in
March
of
last
year,
its
user
base
has
doubled
each
month.
Another
function
of
corporate
HR
teams
that
tech
startups
are
looking
to
replicate
is
employee
development.
“It
used
to
be
that
performance
reviews
were
this
once-a-year,
scary,
anxiety-producing
thing
where
you
would
get
your
bonus,
or
get
fired,”
says
Jack
Altman,
who
founded
people
management
platform
Lattice
alongside
Eric
Koslow
in
2016.
“People
hated
it.
It
was
consistently
rated
the
least
pleasant
part
of
people's
jobs,
and
it
took
forever.”
With
$100
million
in
funding
at
a
$450
million
valuation,
Altman
says
Lattice
was
built
to
encourage,
not
evaluate,
employees.
Managers
and
workers
at
more
than
2,500
companies—including
Reddit,
Asana
and
Cruise—use
the
platform
to
continuously
give
and
receive
performance
feedback,
set
goals
and
map
out
career
trajectories.&nbsp;
“What
we
bet
on
was
this
emerging,
new
trend
of
continuous
performance
management,”
Altman,
31,
says.
“The
idea
was:
Can
you
break
up
that
once-a-year,
long,
arduous
performance
review
that
put
the
company
at
the
center
...
smash
that
into
a
bunch
of
little
pieces,
scatter
them
across
the
whole
12
months
of
the
year,
and
make
it
all
about
the
employee?”
When
working
from
home,
the
sense
of
connection
provided
by
tools
like
Lattice
can
be
essential
to
employees.
Bambee’s
Jones
believes
it
can
be
just
as
important
to
employers.
In
order
to
cope
with
the
challenges
associated
with
long-term
remote
work,
business
leaders,
he
says,
have
had
to
be
more
honest
with
their
Bambee
HR
managers
than
ever
before.&nbsp;
“The
stakes
have
been
so
high,”
Jones
says.
“The
way
that
I
look
at
it
is:
Covid
acted
as
a
giant,
year-long
Super
Bowl
ad
about
how
businesses
need
HR.”
