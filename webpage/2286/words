It's
Time
To
Bring
Greenwashing
Under Control
For
too
long,
we
have
allowed
companies
to
use
confusing
terms
and
unsubstantiated
assertions
to
report
their
supposed
efforts
to
set
environmental
targets.
Adopting
a
unified,
standardized
approach,
rather
than
relying
on
voluntarism
that
has
proven
not
to
work,
is
a
good
first
step.

In
order
to
do
the
right
thing
for
his
shareholders,
for
the
world,
and
to
preserve
his
legacy,
Warren
Buffet
needs
to

his

and
vote
in
favor
of
the
shareholder
proposal
submitted
by
CalPERS,
Federated
Hermes,
and
CDPQ
for
annual

New
U.S.
Transport
Secretary
Says
“In
the
50s
the
mentality
around
roads
was
that
they
existed
for
one
purpose
and
that
was
to
move
as
many
cars
as
you
could
as
fast
as
you
could,”
the
new
U.
S.
transport
secretary
has
told
a
conference,
adding
that
one
of
his
priorities
will
be
to
halt
and
reverse
that
mentality.
