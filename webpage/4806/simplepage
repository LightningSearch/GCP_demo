Facebook is defined by our unique culture – one that rewards impact. We encourage our people to be bold and solve the problems they care most about. Facebook employees work in small teams that move fast and iterate to develop new products. Together, we help others build stronger communities—and we&#039;re just getting started. Bringing the world closer to what matters most What does it mean to do something that&#039;s bigger than ourselves? A common thread that&#039;s woven through the fabric of Facebook is that we&#039;re people who are always curious—about each other, our communities, and the entire world. Video What matters most? Building and Scaling for a Complex World So far, we&#039;ve connected over three billion people—which means we still have more than four billion to go. The work our teams do make a real difference in the lives of people around the world. Over time, we’ve expanded the Facebook family to include Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, Oculus, Portal, Workplace, and Novi—because when it comes to bringing the world closer together, we’re just getting started. Innovation We believe that innovation leads to a more connected world. Our company mission guides our innovative decision making, from the way our teams think, plan, and build, to hardware initiatives, AI, commerce, Facebook Reality Labs, and beyond. Learn More Connectivity With Facebook Connectivity, we bring internet access to everyone on the planet. This gives people more ways to communicate, strengthens community bonds, and gives people the power to create more economic opportunities. Learn More Artificial Intelligence We use AI to help people get information that’s important to them in a more seamless way. For example, automatically captioning photos helps people with visual impairments experience the world and connect with those they care about. Learn More Augmented and Virtual Reality We use AR and VR to build powerful new ways for people to express themselves and connect with others. By leading the development of this kind of technology, we ensure people can continue to enjoy state-of-the-art AR effects and VR experiences.
