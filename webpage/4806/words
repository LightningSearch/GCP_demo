Why
Facebook?
Facebook
is
defined
by
our
unique
culture
–
one
that
rewards
impact.
We
encourage
our
people
to
be
bold
and
solve
the
problems
they
care
most
about.
Facebook
employees
work
in
small
teams
that
move
fast
and
iterate
to
develop
new
products.
Together,
we
help
others
build
stronger
communities—and
we&#039;re
just
getting
started.
Bringing
the
world
closer
to
what
matters
most
What
does
it
mean
to
do
something
that&#039;s
bigger
than
ourselves?
A
common
thread
that&#039;s
woven
through
the
fabric
of
Facebook
is
that
we&#039;re
people
who
are
always
curious—about
each
other,
our
communities,
and
the
entire
world.

What
matters
most?
Building
and
Scaling
for
a
Complex
World
So
far,
we&#039;ve
connected
over
three
billion
people—which
means
we
still
have
more
than
four
billion
to
go.
The
work
our
teams
do
make
a
real
difference
in
the
lives
of
people
around
the
world.
Over
time,
we’ve
expanded
the
Facebook
family
to
include
Instagram,
WhatsApp,
Messenger,
Oculus,
Portal,
Workplace,
and
Novi—because
when
it
comes
to
bringing
the
world
closer
together,
we’re
just
getting
started.
Innovation
We
believe
that
innovation
leads
to
a
more
connected
world.
Our
company
mission
guides
our
innovative
decision
making,
from
the
way
our
teams
think,
plan,
and
build,
to
hardware
initiatives,
AI,
commerce,
Facebook
Reality
Labs,
and
beyond.
Learn
More
Connectivity
With
Facebook
Connectivity,
we
bring
internet
access
to
everyone
on
the
planet.
This
gives
people
more
ways
to
communicate,
strengthens
community
bonds,
and
gives
people
the
power
to
create
more
economic
opportunities.
Learn
More
Artificial
Intelligence
We
use
AI
to
help
people
get
information
that’s
important
to
them
in
a
more
seamless
way.
For
example,
automatically
captioning
photos
helps
people
with
visual
impairments
experience
the
world
and
connect
with
those
they
care
about.

More
Augmented
and
Virtual
Reality
We
use
AR
and
VR
to
build
powerful
new
ways
for
people
to
express
themselves
and
connect
with
others.
By
leading
the
development
of
this
kind
of
technology,
we
ensure
people
can
continue
to
enjoy
state-of-the-art
AR
effects
and
VR
experiences.
