Sedans
and
hatchbacks
comprise
a
little
under
one
in
four
of
new
vehicles
sold
in
the
U.S.
That’s
a
steep
decline
from
2000
or
even
2012,
when
cars
and
light
trucks
were
split
50/50
in
terms
of
consumer
preference.
Crossovers
have
taken
a
big
bite
out
of
the
sedan
market,
leading
some
automakers
to
pare
back
their
car
offerings.
Come
2021,
the
Buick,
Ford
and
Lincoln
brands
will
sell
only
SUVs,
give
or
take
the
Mustang.
Don’t
count
sedans
out
just
yet
though.
There
are
still
lots
of
buyers—more
than
3
million
so
far
this
year,
according
to
MotorIntelligence—who
prefer
cars.
Cars
are
easy
to
live
with:
They’re
generally
quieter,
smoother,
better
handling
and
more
fuel-efficient
than
their
SUV
counterparts.
Some
people
just
prefer
the
familiarity
of
a
traditional
car.
The
winnowing
of
the
sedan
and
hatchback
universe
means
the
remaining
options
must
stand
out
in
terms
of
performance,
safety
and
efficiency.
Style
also
is
a
huge
factor
now
that
over
half
the
market
has
defected
to
crossovers
and
SUV
in
search
of
more
utility.
While
Detroit
may
be
throttling
back
on
four-doors,
automakers
from
Asia
and
Europe
are
hedging
their
bets,
and
in
some
cases
expanding
their
offerings
to
cater
to
these
customers.
The
Forbes
Wheels
10
Best
Sedans
for
2021
features
three
entries
from
Germany,
three
from
Japan
and
four
from
South
Korea.
The
nominees
and
winners
were
selected
by
the
2020
Forbes
Wheels
Car
of
the
Year
panel,
comprising
four
staff
editors
and
seven
contributors.
Our
criteria
included
performance,
safety,
technology,
comfort
and
convenience,
fuel
economy,
design
and
functionality.
Because
each
category
spans
the
full
spectrum
of
pricing,
we
selected
vehicles
that
stand
out
among
their
peers.
Vehicles
eligible
for
nomination
include
any
car
or
truck
for
sale
or
in
production
during
2020;
some
debuted
prior
to
2020.

Why
We
Picked
It
The
TLX
is
all-new
for
2021
and
a
dramatic
departure
from
the
previous
TLX.
Longer,
lower,
and
wider,
it
rides
an
all-new
platform
clothed
in
a
prettier,
more
athletic
shape
than
its
predecessor.
The
makeover
is
part
of
an
ongoing
reinvention
of
the
Acura
brand.
The
automaker
is
specifically
to
recapture
the
sporty
image
it
had
in
the
1990s
and
the
new
TLX
offers
a
more
involving
but
still
luxurious
driving
experience.
The
regular
TLX’s
2.0-liter
four-cylinder
engine
returns
272
horsepower,
up
66
horses
from
the
2020
model.
As
before
TLXs
can
be
had
with
front
or
all-wheel
drive.
Acura
will
soon
add
an
even
sportier
335-horsepower
V6
Type
S
version.
Pros
&
Cons
Updated
infotainment
and
audio
system
catch
up
to
competitors.
Powerful
base
engine
and
quick-shifting
transmission.
Well-rounded
suite
of
standard
features
and
driver
safety
systems
Significant
price
increase
over
outgoing
model.
V6
engine
option
won’t
become
available
until
Spring
2021.
No
announced
integrations
with

Why
We
Picked
It
Audi’s
A5
began
life
in
2007
as
a
stylish
and
sporty
two-door
version
of
the
A4
sedan.
In
time
it
gained
a
sleek
fastback
“four
door
coupe”
bodystyle,
the
Sportback,
and
the
A5
was
totally
redesigned
for
2017.
The
Sportback’s
four
doors
make
it
more
practical
than
the
A5
coupe
and
cabriolet,
but
it
sacrifices
none
of
their
slick
styling
or
sharp
driving
dynamics.
All
A5’s
are
all-wheel
drive
and
packed
with
modern
tech
and
luxury
features,
including
massaging
front
seats
on
the
S5
and
RS5.
Regular
A5’s
start
out
with
201-
or
261-horsepower
four-cylinder
engines
while
the
performance-oriented
S5
offers
a
349-horsepower
V6.
If
that’s
not
enough,
the
nearly
track-ready
RS5
has
twin
turbos
and
444
horses.

Why
We
Picked
It
Many
cars
have
tried

head-to-head
with
the
BMW
3
Series
and
Mercedes-Benz
C-class,
and
few
have
succeeded
as
well
as
the
new-in-2017
Genesis
G70.
Though
heavily-optioned
BMWs
will

it,
the
G70
offers
style,
speed
and
luxury
on
par
with
its
rivals
for
far
less
money,
model
for
model.
The
G70
comes
with
either
a
252-horsepower
2.0-liter
four-cylinder
engine
or
a
365-horsepower
V6
and
rear-
or
all-wheel
drive.
It
also
offers
a
manual
transmission
for
enthusiasts,
which
the
3
Series
no
longer
does.
Its
cabin
is
visually
striking
and
rich
with

too.
Genesis
may
not

more
than

Why
We
Picked
It
The
G80
is
all-new
for
2021,
and
replaces
the
original
G80,
which
formed
the
basis
of
the
Genesis
brand
in
2016.
The
redesigned
G80
looks
the
part
of
an
opulent
luxury
car
inside
and
out.
It
sports
a
sleek
fastback
profile
and
lots
of
delicate
chrome
detailing
outside.
On
the
inside
it’s
restrained
but
beautifully
detailed
and
user
friendly,
with
a
massive
and
easy-to-use
14.5-inch
infotainment
screen
atop
the
dashboard.
The
sum
is
a
car
that
looks
and
feels
as
expensive
as
rivals
from
Audi
or
Mercedes-Benz,
but
as
with
the
other
Genesis
models
sells
for
thousands
less.
Power
comes
from
a
300-horsepower
2.5-liter
turbocharged
four-cylinder
engine
or
a
twin-turbo
375-horsepower
V6;
both

The
G80
is
all-new
for
2021,
and
replaces
the
original
G80,
which
formed
the
basis
of
the
Genesis
brand
in
2016.
The
redesigned
G80
looks
the
part
of
an
opulent
luxury
car
inside
and
out.
It
sports
a
sleek
fastback
profile
and
lots
of
delicate
chrome
detailing
outside.
On
the
inside
it’s
restrained
but
beautifully
detailed
and
user
friendly,
with
a
massive
and
easy-to-use
14.5-inch
infotainment
screen
atop
the
dashboard.
The
sum
is
a
car
that
looks
and
feels
as
expensive
as
rivals
from
Audi
or
Mercedes-Benz,
but
as
with
the
other
Genesis
models
sells
for
thousands
less.
Power
comes
from
a
300-horsepower
2.5-liter
turbocharged
four-cylinder
engine
or
a
twin-turbo
375-horsepower
V6;
both
in

Price

Why
We
Picked
It
The
Accord
has
been
a
quality
car
and
a
market
leader
among
family
sedans
since
the
first
Accord
sedan
was
introduced
in
1977.
The
tenth-generation
Accord
was
introduced
in
2018
and
was
again
a
benchmark
against
which
other
family
sedans
are
judged;
a
practical
and
reliable
all-arounder.
The
car’s
long,
sloping
roof,
creased
fenders
and
bluff
front
end
give
it
lots
of
character,
something
missing
from
the
Accord
since
the
mid-1990s,
and
it’s
been
given
some
light
visual
updates
for
2021.
It
handles
and
drives
enthusiastically,
too.
Honda,
long
averse
to
turbocharging
in
road
cars,
equips
the
Accord
with
a
pair
of
turbocharged
four-cylinder
engines,
a
192-horsepower
1.5-liter
and
a
252-horsepower
2.0-liter,
both
of
them
eager
and
frugal.
Lightest
of
all
on
fuel
is
the
212-horsepower
Accord
Hybrid,
which
returns
48
mpg,
city
or
highway,
according
to
the
EPA.
In
fine
Honda
tradition,
the
Accord’s
interior
is
logical,
practical,
and
user
friendly.
Pros
&
Cons
Sleek
styling
and
involving
driving
experience
Hybrid
offerings
perform
almost
identically
to
conventional
models
User-friendly
infotainment
system
The
trunk
has

surprisingly
narrow

noise

Why
We
Picked
It
Introduced
in
2019
as
a
2020
model,
Hyundai’s
eighth-generation
Sonata
has
come
a
long
way
since
the
first
U.S.-bound
models
were
sold
here
in
1989.
Though
only
marginally
larger
than
the
2019
Sonata,
the
2020
model
is
1.5
inches
lower
and
its
eye-catching,
shark-nosed
styling
makes
it
look
bigger
than
it
actually
is.
It
isn’t
as
aggressive
to
drive
as
it
looks,
but
it’s
a
decent
performer
with
its
1.6-liter,
180-horsepower
or
2.5-liter,
192-horsepower
four-cylinder
engines.
Performance
from
the
fuel-sipping
hybrid,
with
a
192-horsepower
1.6-liter
four,
is
similar.
At
the
top
end
of
the
lineup,
there’s
a
much
more
powerful
N
Line
version,
with
a
290-horsepower
2.5-liter
four.
The
Sonata
hybrid
gets
51
mpg
highway.
The
Sonata
excels
on
value,
packing
a
large
standard
suite
of
driver
assistance
technology
and
many
desirable
features
at
a
relatively
low
price.
Pros
&
Cons
Uncharacteristically
cool
styling
Lots
of
class-above
tech
Efficient
engines
Aside
from
the
N
Line,
less
power
than

rivals
No

Smooth
to

building
on
the

style

value
introduced
on
earlier
generations
of
the
Optima.

and

them

The
clean,
modern
interior
is
packed
with
nice
features,
and
like
the
related
Hyundai
Sonata,
a
good
complement
of
standard
driver-assist
goodies.
A
long
options
list
means
buyers
can
configure
the
K5
in
many
different
ways,
but
all
are
good
values.
Most
K5’s

Why
We
Picked
It
Mazda,
adept
at
making
seemingly
ordinary
cars
lots
of
fun
to
drive,
has
steadily
improved
the
Mazda3
through
four
generations
since
2004.
The
most
recent
arrived
in
2019.
In
style
and
feel,
it
could
easily
pass
for
a
premium-brand
machine,
with
show
car
styling
and
a
clean,
modern
interior
with
obvious
attention
to
detail.
It
comes
as
a
sedan
or
hatchback,
the
latter
offering
more
cargo
space
and
a
curvaceous
shape
that
always
looks
like
it’s
in
motion.
In
2020,
all
models
were
powered
by
a
186-horsepower
2.5-liter
four-cylinder
engine,
with
front-
or
all-wheel
drive.
For
2021,
there
are
new
models
on
both
ends:
a
2.0-liter
155-horsepower
base
model
with
front-wheel
drive,
and
an
optional
250-horsepower
turbocharged
2.5-liter
version
with
front-
or
all-wheel
drive.
An
engaging
and
rewarding
drive
for
an
enthusiast,
there’s
even
an
optional
manual
transmission,
but
the
Mazda3
doesn’t
demand
any
compromises
from
regular
consumers
who
just
want
really
nice
transportation.
Pros
&
Cons
Great

Classy

Why

The
latest
in

long
line
of
Mercedes-Benz’s
midsize
standard
bearers,
the
current
E-class
was
introduced
for
2017
and
has
been
recently
refreshed
for
2021,
with
updated
styling
and
some
additional
models.
It

Mercedes-Benz
traditions
as

being

with
state-of-the-art
technology,
including
a
full
complement

Why
We
Picked
It
2021
will
be
the
Volkswagen
Golf’s
final
year
in
the
USA,
though
the
Golf
GTI
will
live
on.
That’s
a
shame,
because
even
though
the
current
seventh-generation
Golf
dates
back
to
2013,
it’s
still
a
high-quality,
practical
value
machine.
The
Golf
and
GTI
share
the
same
cavernous,
comfy,
no-nonsense
interior
and
upright
hatchback
body,
though
the
GTI
clothes
the
inside
in
nicer
materials.
The
Golf
is
motivated
by
a
1.4-liter
147-horsepower
four-cylinder
engine
while
the
GTI
uses
a
2.0-liter
228-horsepower
four.
Both
are
turbocharged
and
both
offer
manual
or
automatic
transmissions.
The
GTI
is
faster,
with
higher
handling
limits,
but
both
are
fun
to
drive,
reasonably
priced,
and
have
lots
of
cargo
space.
Pros
&
Cons
Premium,
well-engineered
feel
Involving
driving
dynamics
Textbook
space
efficiency
Plain
Jane
styling
Lackluster
infotainment
experience
Competitors
