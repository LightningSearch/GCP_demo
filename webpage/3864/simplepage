However, the human presence within complex networks inherently creates privacy and governance vulnerabilities, particularly in the visibility, control, and protection over how, when, and where data is made available to the people who use it every day.   Though modern cybersecurity is inherently multi-layered, the deepest layer must include modern data security governance that protects against privileged access and human error. Watch on-demand to hear Lou Senko, CIO of Q2, and Doug Wick, VP of Product and Marketing for ALTR, explore how a large, publicly traded financial experience (FinX) company is using innovative solutions to provide the ultimate failsafe to its customers, as well as: •    Best practices for keeping sensitive financial data safe •    How to gain transparent visibility and control over your data •    How blockchain technology can support the restoration of digital trust.

For banks to remain relevant – or better yet – increase their relevance in customer’s eyes, they need to operate from an entirely different CX paradigm. Banks need to orchestrate increasingly complex systems of engagement and support a broad range of use cases along the shop-buy-use continuum. Beyond just sales and marketing, banks must develop and nurture customer relationships flexibly along the entire customer lifecycle with fewer in-person interactions. In this webinar, Celent’s Bob Meara will review recent consumer research which suggests a significant and tangible gap between transactional and advisory trust among U.S. banked adults. What was discussed? Defining the Trust Gap in retail banking and illustrate its root causes How leading banks are closing the Trust Gap through redefining the in-person and digital customer experience How banks must re-tool to deliver excellent CX as engagement becomes increasingly digital Practical next steps to take in improving your customers&#8217; trust in your organization, regardless of where you are in your transformational journey Share this: Send Post Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Posts navigation 1 2 Next &rarr; Search Search for: FinovateEurope-blog FinovateSpring-blog FinovateAsia-blog FinovateFall-blog FinovateAwards-blog FinovateFocus-blog Subscribe by Email Want us to cover your news?
