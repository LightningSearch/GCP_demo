Time
Duration:
&nbsp;1
hour
The
PSD2
requirement
for
Strong
Customer
Authentication,
combined
with
Mastercard’s
mandate
on
biometrics,
has
led
to
an
increase
in
the
deployment
of
biometrics
as
one
of
the
2
factors
of
authentication.&nbsp;A
strong
preference
from
consumers
for
its
ease
of
use
is
also
driving
adoption.
Join
this
webinar
,
with
BNPP
Personal
Finance,
Mastercard,
and
Fabrick,
as
they
share
their
experience
of
deploying

(IDCM),
MasterCard’s
biometric
authentication
solution
for
online
payments.
The
expert
panel
will
tackle
the
topics
including
how
the
solution
can
help
issuers
meet
regulatory
requirements
and
how
biometrics
can
deliver
additional
value-added
services
to
maximize
return
on
investment.
The
speakers
will
take
time
during
the
discussion
to
answer
questions
from
the
audience
&#8211;

to

Time:

AM
Eastern
Standard
Time
Duration:
 1
hour
Traditional
wealth
management
processes
are
not
designed
for
the
digital
age.
Firms
need
digital
solutions
that
address
clients&#8217;
rising
expectations
for
digital
experiences
and
expand
service
offerings
while
reducing
operational
complexity.
Going
digital,
however,
isn&#8217;t
for
the
faint
of
heart.
With
85%
of
projects
going
over
schedule
and
70%
of
large-scale
digital
IT
programs
failing
to
even
reach
their
stated
goals,
developing
enterprise
software
can
be
a
painfully
inefficient
affair.
This
is
where
Unqork&#8217;s
no-code
platform
can
be
a
game-changer.
Join
this
upcoming
webinar
&nbsp;to
learn
more
about
how
the
wealth
and
investment
management
industry
is
being
disrupted,
and
what
you
can
do
to
stay
ahead
of
the
curve.

When
development
and
compliance
are
handled
separately
financial
services
organizations
often
run
into
challenges.
These
challenges
can
be
remediated
with
solid
IT
Automation
practices.
Without
IT
Automation
a
lot
of
time
and
money
must
be
used
to
remain
up-to-date,
compliant,
and
secure.
A
robust
automation
strategy
is
an
answer,
and
89%
of
FIs
agree:
it
is
one
of
their
top
priorities.
But
only
around
18%
of
the
industry
is
doing
this
effectively.&nbsp;
Join
the
latest
#FinovateWebinar,
where
we
explore
the
focus
areas
that
can
be
streamlined
while
deploying
IT
automation
resulting
inteams
that
are
more
productive,
reduced
errors,
improved
collaboration,
and
more
time
spent
on
more
meaningful,
thoughtful
work.&nbsp;
The
session
will
look
at:
Identifying,
preempting,
and
overcoming
internal
resistance
challenges
like a
lack
of
dedicated
resources
and
a
lack
of
executive
buy-in 
Assessing

Overcoming

When
COVID-19
hit,
the
financial
services
sector
was
faced
with
an
abrupt
realization
that
digital
transformation
needed
to
accelerate.
While
moving
to
a
digital-first
approach
is
a
massive
undertaking,
it
can
be
tackled
over
a
period
of
time.&nbsp;
Financial
services
can
see
impactful
digital
changes
implemented
in
hours,
not
years.
Most
importantly,
digital
transformation
places
clients
at
the
center
of
business.
An&nbsp;
exceptional
customer
support
experience
distinguishes
leading
financial
services
from
the
rest
,
helping
to
retain
clients
well
beyond
these
unprecedented
times.
Watch

Alex
Mack,
Sr.
Solutions
PMM,

Success,

a

webinar.
They’ll
discuss 
quick
steps
financial
institutions
can
take
to
digitize
their
customer
experiences
 at
a
time
when
scaling
support
operations
is
crucial.
They’ll
walk
through
digital
customer
support
initiatives
that
are
quick
to
deploy
and
can
deliver
big
results.
Learn
how
to:
Express
empathy
and
build
trust
through
personalization
Scale
customer
support
with
help
centers
and
AI
Move
customer
conversations
to
SMS,
social,
and

platforms
Empower

However,
the

How

in

Customer
preferences
and
expectations
are
rapidly
changing.
For
banks
to
remain
relevant
–
or
better
yet
–
increase
their
relevance
in
customer’s
eyes,
they
need
to
operate
from
an
entirely
different
CX
paradigm.
Banks
need
to
orchestrate
increasingly
complex
systems
of
engagement
and
support
a
broad
range
of
use
cases
along
the
shop-buy-use
continuum.
Beyond
just
sales
and
marketing,
banks
must
develop
and
nurture
customer
relationships
flexibly
along
the
entire
customer
lifecycle
with
fewer
in-person
interactions.
In
this
webinar,
Celent’s
Bob
Meara
will
review
recent
consumer
research
which
suggests
a
significant
and
tangible
gap
between
transactional
and
advisory
trust
among
U.S.
banked
adults.
What
was
discussed?
Defining
the
Trust
Gap
in
retail
banking
and
illustrate
its
root
causes
How
leading
banks
are
closing
the
Trust
Gap
through
redefining
the
in-person
and
digital
customer
experience
How
banks
must
re-tool
to
deliver
excellent
CX
as
engagement
becomes
increasingly
digital
Practical
next
steps
to
take
in
improving
your
customers&#8217;
trust
in
your
organization,
regardless
of
where
you
are

your
transformational
journey
