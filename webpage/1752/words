Unstructured
data
is
data
that
isn’t
organized
in
a
pre-defined
fashion
or
lacks
a
specific
data
model.
Meanwhile,
structured
data
is
data
that
has
clear,
definable
relationships
between
the
data
points,
with
a
pre-defined
model
containing
it.
That’s
the
short
answer
on
the
difference
between
structured
and
unstructured
data,
but
let’s
take
a
closer
look
at
the
differences
between
the
two
types
of
data.
What
is
Structured
Data?
When
it
comes
to
computer
science,
data
structures
refer
to
specific
ways
of
storing
and
organizing
data.
Different
data
structures
possess
different
relationships
between
data
points,
but
data
can
also
be
unstructured.
What
does
it
mean
to
say
that
data
is
structured?
To
make
this
definition
clearer,
let’s
take
a
look
at
some
of
the
various
ways
of
structuring
data.
Structured
data
is
often
held
in
tables
such
as
Excel
files
or
SQL
databases.
In
these
cases,
the
rows
and
columns
of
the
data
hold
different
variables
or
features,
and
it
is
often
possible
to
discern
the
relationship
between
data
points
by
checking
to
see
where
data
rows
and
columns
intersect.
Structured
data
can
easily
be
fit
into
a
relational
database,
and
examples
of
different
features
in
a
structured
dataset
can
include
items
like
names,
addresses,
dates,
weather
statistics,
credit
card
numbers,
etc.
While
structured
data
is
most
often
text
data,
it
is
possible
to
store
things
like
images
and
audio
as
structured
data
as
well.
Common
sources
of
structured
data
include
things
like
data
collected
from
sensors,
weblogs,
network
data,
and
retail
or
e-commerce
data.
Structured
data
can
also
be
generated
by
people
filling
in
spreadsheets
or
databases
with
data
collected
from
computers
and
other
devices.
For
instance,
data
collected
through
online
forms
is
often
immediately
fed
into
a
data
structure.
Structured
data
has
a
long
history
of
being
stored
in
relational
databases
and
SQL.
These
storage
methods
are
popular
because
of
the
ease
of
reading
and
writing
in
these
formats,
with
most
platforms
and
languages
being
able
to
interpret
these
data
formats.
In
a
machine
learning
context,
structured
data
is
easier
to
train
a
machine
learning
system
on,
because
the
patterns
within
the
data
are
more
explicit.
Certain
features
can
be
fed
into
a
machine
learning
classifier
and
used
to
label
other
data
instances
based
on
those
selected
features.
In
contrast,
training
a
machine
learning
system
on
unstructured
data
tends
to
be
more
difficult,
for
reasons
that
will
become
clear.
What
is
Unstructured
Data?
Unstructured
data
is
data
that
isn’t
organized
according
to
a
pre-defined
data
model
or
structure.
Unstructured
data
is
often
called
qualitative
data
because
it
can’t
be
analyzed
or
processed
in
traditional
ways
using
the
regular
methods
used
for
structured
data.
Because
unstructured
data
doesn’t
have
any
defined
relationships
between
data
points,
it
can’t
be
organized
in
relational
databases.
In
contrast,
the
way
unstructured
data
is
stored
is
typically
with
a
NoSQL
database
,
or
a
non-relational
database.
If
the
structure
of
the
database
is
of
little
concern,
a
data
lake,
or
a
large
pool
of
unstructured
data,
can
be
used
to
store
the
data
instead
of
a
NoSQL
database.
Unstructured
data
is
difficult
to
analyze,
and
making
sense
of
unstructured
data
often
involves
examining
individual
pieces
of
data
to
discern
potential
features
and
then
looking
to
see
if
those
features
occur
in
other
pieces
of
data
within
the
pool.
The
vast
majority
of
data
is
in
unstructured
formats,
with
estimates
that
unstructured
data
comprises
around
80%
of
all
data.
Data
mining
techniques
can
be
used
to
help
structure
data.
In
terms
of
machine
learning,
certain
techniques
can
help
order
unstructured
data
and
turn
it
into
structured
data.
A
popular
tool
for
turning
unstructured
data
into
structured
data
is
a
system
called
an
autoencoder.
