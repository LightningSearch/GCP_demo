The
focus
on
the
customer
and
their
experiences
has
dominated
the
conversation
within
financial
services
over
the
past
few
years,
but
seems
to
have
become
especially
pertinent
in
2019.
In
our
latest
eMagazine,
we
examine
the
fintechs
and
institutions
leading
the
way
with
excellent
service
and
products
that
delight
customers,
both
locally
and
globally.
This
eMagazine
features
exclusive
session
recordings
from
the
stage
of
FinovateFall&#8211;
including
insight
and
analysis
on
APIs,
consumer
lending
platforms,
and
content
and
communication
management.
Over
the
course
of
reading
you&#8217;ll
find
new
ways
of
thinking
about
becoming
truly
customer-centric.
