About

Founded
by
researchers,
built
for
enterprise
The
Clinc
story
has
its
roots
in
a
research
collaboration
project
between
a
group
of
PhDs
at
the
University
of
Michigan.
Having
recognized
that
conversational
AI
had
made
few
significant
advances
in
the
decade
since
the
advent
of
Siri,
the
team
believed
that
cutting-edge
breakthroughs
in
computing
technology
combined
with
Natural
Language
Processing
held
the
key
to
a
new
frontier
in
conversational
AI
technology.
