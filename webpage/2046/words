Researchers
from
MIT
have
recently
developed
a
new
AI-driven
technique
to
speed
up
the
discovery
of
drugs
by
increasing
the
speed
of
calculations
used
to
assess
the
molecular
binding
affinity
of
a
drug
.
A
drug
must
be
able
to
stick
to
proteins
in
order
to
carry
out
the
task
it
was
designed
for.
Assessing
the
ability
of
a
drug
to
stick
to
proteins
is
a
major
part
of
the
drug
discovery
and
screening
process,
and
machine
learning
techniques
could
reduce
the
amount
of
time
spent
assessing
this
important
drug
attribute.
The
MIT
research
team
responsible
for
developing
the
new
drug
assessment
technique
calls
it
DeepBAR.
DeepBAR
combines
machine
learning
algorithms
with
traditional
chemistry
calculations.
DeepBAR
calculates
the
binding
potential
of
a
given
candidate
drug
and
that
drug’s
target
proteins.
The
new
analysis
technique
delivers
estimates
of
a
drug’s
binding
capability
substantially
faster
than
traditional
methods
used
to
assess
binding
affinities,
and
it’s
hoped
that
the
technique
can
enhance
the
speed
of
drug
discovery.
The
binding
potential
of
a
drug
is
quantified
through
a
metric
called
binding
free
energy,
where
a
smaller
number
indicates
greater
binding
potential.
A
low
binding
free
energy
score
means
that
a
drug
has
a
great
ability
to
compete
with
other
molecules,
filling
the
roles
of
those
molecules
and
disrupting
the
normal
function
of
a
protein.
There’s
a
high
correlation
between
the
binding
free
energy
of
a
drug
candidate
and
the
effectiveness
of
that
drug.
However,
measuring
binding
free
energy
can
be
quite
difficult.
There
are
two
typical
techniques
used
to
measure
free
binding
energies.
One
method
is
calculating
the
exact
quantity
of
binding
free
energy,
while
the
other
is
estimating
the
quantity
of
binding
free
energy.
Estimates
are
less
computationally
expensive
than
exact
measurements,
but
they
obviously
come
with
a
tradeoff
inaccuracy.
The
DeepBAR
method
uses
a
fraction
of
the
computational
power
of
exact
measuring
methods
but
delivers
highly
accurate
estimates
of
binding
energies.
DeepBAR
employs
the
“Bennett
acceptance
ratio”,
which
is
the
algorithm
typically
used
to
calculate
binding
free
energy.
The
Bennet
acceptance
ratio
requires
the
use
of
two
baseline/endpoint
states
and
a
variety
of
intermediates
states
(which
are
states
of
partial
binding).
The
DeepBAR
approach
attempts
to
reduce
the
number
of
calculations
needed
to
estimate
binding
energies
by
utilizing
the
Bennett
acceptance
ratio
alongside
machine-learning
frameworks
and
deep
generative
models.
The
machine
learning
models
generate
a
reference
state
for
each
endpoint
and
these
endpoints
are
accurate
enough
to
the
real
endpoints
that
a
Bennett
acceptance
ratio
can
be
deployed.
The
deep
generative
model
designed
by
the
MIT
research
team
is
based
on
computer
vision
techniques.
Essentially,
DeepBAR
treats
every
molecular
structure
it
analyzes
an
as
image,
analyzing
the
features
of
the
“image”
to
learn
for
them.
The
research
team
had
to
make
slight
changes
to
the
algorithm
to
accommodate
analysis
of
the
3D
structures,
as
computer
vision
algorithms
typically
operate
on
2D
images.
In
initial
tests,
DeepBAR
was
able
to
calculate
binding
free
energy
approximately
50
times
faster
than
traditional
techniques.
There
is
still
work
to
be
done
on
the
model.
It
has
to
be
validated
against
more
complex,
experimental
data
than
the
rather
simple
data
it
was
initially
tested
on,
which
involved
fairly
simple
data.
The
MIT
research
team
aims
to
improve
DeepBar’s
ability
to
calculate
binding
free
energies
for
large
proteins
by
refining
the
model
using
recent
advances
in
computer
science.
DeepBAR
is
far
from
the
first
attempt
to
apply
AI
to
the
drug
discovery
pipeline
with
the
goal
of
increasing
the
speed
of
drug
discovery.
Many
other
research
projects
have
also
used
AI
to
automate
aspect
of
the
drug
discovery
pipeline
and
improve
their
efficiency.
However,
there
could
be
a
natural
bottleneck
that
limits
the
effectiveness
of
these
strategies.
As
Derek
Lowe
recently
argued
in
a
blog
on
ScienceMag.org
,
if
the
goal
is
to
enhance
the
speed
of
drug
discovery,
it’s
important
to
“attack
the
right
problems”.
The
evaluation
of
the
clinical
effectiveness
and
safety
of
drugs
takes
a
substantial
amount
of
time
and
finding
ways
to
use
AI
to
reduce
clinical
failure
rates
is
difficult.
Ultimately,
there
could
be
a
lower
bound
on
the
amount
of
time
AI
methods
can
save
in
terms
of
drug
discovery,
at
least
until
AI
can
be
meaningfully
integrated
into
the
clinical
evaluation
process.
Nonetheless,
improvements
are
improvements
and
the
more
research
like
DeepBAR
is
done,
the
more
time
scientists
will
have
to
consider
ways
to
use
AI
in
other
areas
of
the
drug
discovery
pipeline.
