Savvy business owners use business credit cards that dole out cash back. Credit cards that fall into this category typically award business owners a percentage of their spending in rewards, and this can truly be “free money” when they pay their credit card bill in full each month and never pay interest on purchases. Many cash back business credit cards offer initial bonuses worth hundreds of dollars or more, and that’s on top of the ongoing rewards you can rack up for each dollar spent. Some cards also offer consumer protections and cardholder perks that can help business owners save money and protect their purchases. If you’re in the market for a new business credit card, Forbes Advisor created this guide to help you cut through the hype and find the absolute best business credit card for your needs and goals.

If short-term cash flow is an issue, you have the option to swap the 5% back for 90-day 0% APR financing on any eligible purchase.

We went through dozens of options and considered the following factors when it came time to cherry-pick our top choices: rewards rate, credit card fees, ease of use, welcome offers and cardholder perks. The Best Cash Back Business Credit Cards Ink Business Unlimited&reg; Credit Card [ jump to details ] The Ink Business Unlimited® Credit Card earns a flat rate 1.5% cash back on all your spending without an annual fee. This card also offers a 0% introductory APR that can help you save money on interest when you make new purchases for the first 12 months you have your card. Rewards: Earn an unlimited 1.5% cash back for each dollar spent. Your earnings can also be converted at a rate of 1 Ultimate Reward point for each 1 cent of cash back if you have a premium Chase card like the Chase Ink Business Preferred® Credit Card, Chase Sapphire Preferred® Card or Chase Sapphire Reserve® Card. Welcome Offer: Earn $750 bonus cash back after you spend $7,500 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening Annual Fee: $0 Other Benefits and Drawbacks: Earning 1.5% for each dollar spent with no annual fee is a winning proposition for business owners who want to earn easy rewards without hassle. Since rewards earned with this card are part of the Chase Ultimate Rewards program, you can also redeem your earnings for statement credits, gift cards, travel and more. Or take the rewards as straight cash back to use however you want. If you pair this card with a premium Chase card like the Chase Ink Business Preferred, Chase Sapphire Preferred or Chase Sapphire Reserve, you’ll unlock the ability to redeem your earnings as Chase Ultimate Rewards . Points can be redeemed for travel for 25 to 50% more, depending on which card you have, or you can transfer your points to travel partners including United and Hyatt. Ink Business Cash&reg; Credit Card [ jump to details ] The Ink Business Cash Credit Card comes with lucrative earning categories at high rewards caps. Since there’s no annual fee, you don’t have to worry about spending enough to break even on the annual fee. Anyone who spends in areas typical to a business may find this card makes a good match for their expenditures. Rewards: Earn 5% cash back on the first $25,000 spent in combined purchases at office supply stores and on internet, cable and phone services each account anniversary year. Earn 2% cash back on the first $25,000 spent in combined purchases at gas stations and restaurants each account anniversary year. Earn 1% cash back on all other purchases. Welcome Offer: Earn $750 bonus cash back after you spend $7,500 on purchases in the first 3 months from account opening Annual Fee: $0 Other Benefits and Drawbacks: The Ink Business Cash Credit Card lets you earn lucrative rewards without an annual fee, so it’s a solid choice for many business owners. The biggest potential drawback is that there are caps in the bonus categories. If you spend a ton of money on business purchases in the elevated earnings categories each year, you might ultimately earn more with a flat-rate earnings card. But you do get employee cards without any additional cost and you’ll also be eligible for auto rental coverage on vehicle rentals used for business purposes, purchase protection, extended warranties and more just for being a cardholder. If you pair this card with a premium Chase card like the Chase Ink Business Preferred, Chase Sapphire Preferred or Chase Sapphire Reserve, you’ll unlock the ability to redeem your earnings as Chase Ultimate Rewards . Points can be redeemed for travel for 25 to 50% more, depending on which card you have, or you can transfer your points to travel partners including United and Hyatt. Capital One® Spark® Cash for Business * The Capital One® Spark® Cash for Business offers simple and generous flat-rate rewards. If you want to earn cash back without tracking bonus categories or spending caps, you should consider this easy-to-use, easy-to-redeem card. Rewards: Earn 2% back for each dollar you spend with no limits. Welcome Bonus: Earn a one-time $500 cash bonus once you spend $4,500 on purchases within 3 months from account opening Annual Fee: $0 intro for first year, $95 after that Other Benefits and Drawbacks: Earning an unlimited 2% back for each dollar spent is a great way for time-pressed proprietors to enjoy simple earnings on their spending. You can take your earnings in any amount at any time. The annual fee though means in year two and beyond you’ll have to spend at least $4,750 a year on the card to break even. American Express Blue Business Cash&trade; Card [ jump to details ] The American Express Blue Business Cash Card is a no-fuss business credit card that lets you earn rewards without an annual fee. Consider this card if you want to want to earn considerable rewards on all your spending without tracking categories and you typically spend $50,000 or less a year. Rewards: Earn 2% cash back on the first $50,000 you spend on eligible purchases each year, then 1%. Welcome Offer: N/A Annual Fee: No annual fee ( see rates and fees ). Other Benefits and Drawbacks: There’s no annual fee and no over-the-limit worries as the American Express Blue Business Cash Card offers flexible spending limits to eligible cardholders if your needs fluctuate from month-to-month. But a business that routinely spends more than $50,000 in a year would fare better with a card that doesn’t cap earnings rates. Capital One Spark® Cash Select for Business * For super-simple rewards without an annual fee, consider the Capital One Spark® Cash Select for Business . This card offers a toned-down rewards structure and a smaller initial bonus when compared to its sibling the Capital One® Spark® Cash for Business, but you won’t pay an annual fee to carry it in your wallet. Rewards: Earn 1.5% back for each dollar you spend with no limits or bonus categories. Welcome Bonus: Earn a one-time $200 cash bonus once you spend $3,000 on purchases within the first 3 months from account opening Annual Fee: $0 Other Benefits and Drawbacks: The biggest potential issue with the Capital One® Spark® Cash Select for Business is that it offers a lower rate of cash rewards than some competing business credit cards. However, you won’t have to pay an annual fee to carry it, so it may still be a better deal if you don’t spend a lot of money on business purchases each year. You’ll get employee cards at no additional cost and can redeem rewards earned with this card in any amount at any time, unlike other cards that have minimum redemption thresholds. Discover it&reg; Business Card * The Discover it Business card might not seem like one of the best cash back earners in the business market at first glance, earning 1.5% cash back on all your spending when there are other cards offering 2%. But the main appeal lies with this card’s generous first-year cash back match. In lieu of a traditional welcome bonus, Discover will match all your earnings at the end of the first year automatically. That means all of the cash back you earn during your first year will be doubled, an unbeatable value for big spenders. Rewards: Earn 1.5% back for each dollar you spend with no limits. Welcome Bonus: Get an unlimited dollar-for-dollar match of all the cash back you earn at the end of your first year, automatically. And no limit to how much we'll match. So you could turn $350 cash back into $700 with Cashback Match™. Annual Fee: $0 Other Benefits and Drawbacks: The cash back match at the end of Year One is the main event with this card, beyond that you can find other cards that can outearn the Discover it Business. It does come with a 0% intro APR for 12 months, followed by 12.99% - 20.99% Variable APR on purchases and balance transfers and up to 50 free employee cards, which might be helpful to some. U.S. Bank Business Leverage&reg; Visa Signature&reg; Card * [ jump to details ] If your business expenses vary from month to month, look to a card like the U.S. Bank Business Leverage Visa Card®, which offers elevated rewards in your top two spending categories each month, automatically adjusting each month to where you spend the most. And, if your business uses U.S Bank to process credit card payments from your customers you can earn additional points from those transactions. Rewards: Earn 2 points per dollar spent in the top two categories from a list of 48 where you spend each month. The categories will automatically adjust each month based on your spending. All other purchases earn 1 point per dollar. Welcome Offer: Earn 75,000 points worth $750 cash back. Just spend $7,500 in eligible net purchases on the Account Owner's Card within the first four months of account opening. Annual Fee: $0 first year, then $95 Other Benefits and Drawbacks: There’s no need to opt-in to bonus categories or track where you’re spending the most since the card will automatically adjust to how you spend. Rewards expire five years from the day on which they were earned, which can be cumbersome to track. If you consistently spend heavily in more than two categories, you’ll likely fare better with a flat-rate rewards card. Bank of America® Business Advantage Cash Rewards Mastercard® credit card * The Bank of America® Business Advantage Cash Rewards Mastercard® lets cardholders choose their highest-earning cash back category from a list of eight. There’s no annual fee, and you can earn additional rewards if you’re an existing Bank of America customer who meets a minimum threshold for money on deposit with the bank through the bank’s Preferred Rewards program. Rewards: Earn 3% back in the category of your choice (gas stations, office supply stores, travel, TV, telecom, and wireless, computer services, or business consulting services), 2% back on dining and 1% back on other purchases. A cap of $50,000 in combined spending each year applies to the 3% and 2% categories combined on this card. Welcome Offer: Get a $300 statement credit when you make at least $3,000 in net purchases within 90 days of your account opening Annual Fee: $0 Other Benefits and Drawbacks: Earning 3% back in a category of your choosing and 2% back at restaurants is nice, but keep in mind that you’ll only earn bonus rewards on up to $50,000 in combined spending in these categories each year. After that threshold is reached, you’ll only earn 1% back. But this card leaps to the front of the pack for Bank of America customers who are part of the Preferred Rewards program. Depending on the total amount a Preferred Rewards Member has in their qualifying accounts, they can earn 25% to 75% more rewards for each dollar they spend on their Bank of American rewards cards. Wells Fargo Business Platinum Credit Card * [ jump to details ] The Wells Fargo Business Platinum Credit Card has a unique choose-your-own-rewards-adventure structure. Holders of the card can either earn a flat 1.5% cash back on every purchase or opt to earn one rewards point for every dollar spent, and get 1,000 bonus points when your company spends $1,000 or more in a billing period plus a 10% rebate when redeeming points online. If you typically spend more than $2,000 a month on a credit card, go for the flat 1.5%. Rewards: Choose between 1.5% cash back rate earning or one rewards point per dollar spent plus 1,000 bonus points every month you spend $1,000 or more. Welcome Offer: Get a one-time $300 cash back bonus or 30,000 bonus points when you enroll in the Business Card Rewards Program and spend $3,000 in the first three months of account open date Annual Fee: $0 Other Benefits and Drawbacks: Having to choose which rewards structure you want can be a nuisance, especially if you aren’t sure what your average monthly spend will be. But if you know which style will work best for you, that’s a moot point. You’ll get additional employee cards for free and for those who choose to receive points, a 10% rebate when you redeem your earnings online. U.S. Bank Business Cash Rewards World Elite&trade; MasterCard® * [ jump to details ] If your business spending centers on gas stations, office supply stores and cell phone or service providers, the U.S. Bank Business Cash Rewards World Elite™ Mastercard earns a hefty return on purchases in these categories. The card also offers a unique end-of-the-year bonus: You’ll get 25% of your prior year&#8217;s cash rewards, up to $250, on your card anniversary. Rewards: Earn 3% cash back on eligible purchases at gas stations, office supply stores and cell phone/service providers. All other spending earns 1% cash back. Welcome Offer: Earn $500 cash back. Just spend $3000 in the first 90 days of opening your account. Annual Fee: $0 Other Benefits and Drawbacks: The opportunity to earn 3% is only meaningful if those three categories are your largest expenses. If not, another card is likely to be a better match. The card also comes with cell phone protection for damage or theft up to $1,000 per year, $800 max per claim, two claims per year. Amazon Business Prime American Express Card * [ jump to details ] The Amazon Business Prime American Express Credit Card is an excellent choice for businesses that either buy a lot from the online store or spend a lot on the Amazon Web Service cloud platform. That’s because it earns high rewards on spending within the Amazon ecosystem and decent rewards on other areas of spending too. Or, opt for no-interest financing instead of rewards and buy yourself some time to pay off a large purchase. Rewards: Earn either 5% back or 90 day 0% financing on U.S. purchases at Amazon Business, AWS, Amazon.com and Whole Foods Market. Earn 5% back on the first $120,000 in purchases each calendar year, 2% back at U.S. restaurants, U.S. gas stations, and on wireless telephone services purchased directly from U.S. service providers and 1% back on other purchases. Welcome Offer: Eligible Prime Members get a $125 Amazon.com Gift Card upon approval for the Amazon Business Prime American Express Card. Annual Fee: $0 Other Benefits and Drawbacks: You can use your rewards towards more purchases on Amazon or take as a statement credit towards previous purchases. But if your spending doesn’t align with the bonus categories on this card, or you simply don’t want to have the Business Prime membership required to apply for this card, seek another option. How to Choose a Business Credit Card for Cash Back Decide whether you prefer bonus categories or flat-rate rewards: If you spend a lot of money in specific categories like office supply stores or dining each year, you may be better off with a credit card that offers more points in these areas. On the other hand, a credit card that offers a high rate of flat-rate rewards may help you earn more points if your spending is spread evenly across multiple categories. Compare welcome bonus offers: To see if you can qualify for the best bonus offers, figure out how much your business spends on average each month. From there, see which bonus offers fit with your average spending style. Look for cardholder perks you want: If you’re interested in credit card benefits like purchase protection or extended warranties , look for business credit cards that offer these perks. Determine how you want to redeem your rewards: Business cards that offer cash back all work differently. Some only let you redeem for statement credits or a check in the mail, while others let you cash in points for gift cards, travel, merchandise and more. Make sure any cards you’re considering offer the redemption options you prefer. Take a close look at annual fees: Finally, make sure to compare business credit cards in terms of their annual fees and other fees. While paying an annual fee can be well worth it, you should make sure you’re getting ample rewards and cardholder benefits in return.

Although business credit cards typically offer higher credit limits than personal cards, if you’re looking for the highest possible limit on a cash back business credit card, know that the limit you’ll actually receive will depend on your credit profile and the amount of business revenue you claim on your application.  If you expect that you’ll occasionally need to spend more on a card than your credit limit, consider a business charge card. With a charge card you’ll have to pay the balance in full every month, unlike a credit card where you can carry a balance. A charge card also doesn’t have a preset spending limit which means you won’t have to worry about being denied for a large purchase. However, the issuer will use your spending patterns to determine an upper limit on the amount you can charge at any one time. Some of Forbes Advisor’s top picks for business charge cards that offer rewards you can take as cash back include: Business Platinum Card® from American Express American Express Blue Business Cash™ Card The Plum Card® from American Express Brex Corporate Card for Startups * American Express® Business Gold Card To view rates and fees of The Business Platinum Card® from American Express, please visit this page .

How To Get A Business Credit Card Getting a cash back business credit card is similar to getting any other type of credit card. Once you’ve identified a card that fits your business’ spending habits, you can apply. A business credit isn’t limited to those who work full-time or have a steady established business. It’s possible to get a cash back business card even if it’s just to use for part-time work, a freelance position or an occasional side gig. How To Apply For A Business Credit Card Most business credit cards can be applied for online or in some cases over the phone or in-branch if it’s a bank-issued card.  If you know how to apply for a personal credit card, the process is similar. You’ll have to provide some basic information including your business’ contact details, annual revenue, industry type and number of employees. You’ll also need your company’s employee identification number (EIN) or, if you don’t have one, your social security number.  Be aware that when you apply for a business credit card, you’re personally guaranteeing that you’ll repay the debt, just like you would for a personal credit card. In other words, if your business goes belly-up, you’re still on the hook for any balance owed. How do cash back business credit cards work? Every time you make a purchase with your cash back business card, you’ll earn a percentage back on your spending. The amount you’ll earn will depend on your particular card’s terms. Those earnings are accumulated in your card’s account and you can redeem them according to your card’s protocols. Some cards let you redeem your cash earnings in any amount, at any time while others require a minimum balance to cash out.  The exact way you’ll receive your cash back also varies by card, with some letting you take those rewards as a statement credit against your balance and others also allowing you to take actual cash back. Which cash back credit card earns the most cash back? There’s no one best cash back business card that will earn the most rewards for everyone. The credit card that will earn you the highest cash back rewards will depend on your business’ spending habits and tolerance for tracking rewards.  For example, the Ink Business Preferred® Credit Card earns 3 Ultimate Rewards points per dollar spent on the first $150,000 each calendar year of combined purchases on travel, shipping purchases, internet, cable and phone services and advertising purchases made with social media sites and search engines. All other spending earns 1 point per dollar spent. If these categories match up with your company’s expenses, the rewards can really add up. But it requires tracking your spending carefully.  If you prefer a simple cash back scheme, a card that earns the same flat rate on all your business spending could be a better fit. Consider the Capital One® Spark® Cash for Business credit card, which earns 2% cash back on everything you buy, whether it’s desk supplies or inventory.
