commission
on

but
that
doesn't
affect
our
editors'
opinions
or

The
Discover

As

Savvy
business
owners
use
business
credit
cards
that
dole
out
cash
back.
Credit
cards
that
fall
into
this
category
typically
award
business
owners
a
percentage
of
their
spending
in
rewards,
and
this
can
truly
be
“free
money”
when
they
pay
their
credit
card
bill
in
full
each
month
and
never
pay
interest
on
purchases.
Many
cash
back
business
credit
cards
offer
initial
bonuses
worth
hundreds
of
dollars
or
more,
and
that’s
on
top
of
the
ongoing
rewards
you
can
rack
up
for
each
dollar
spent.
Some
cards
also
offer
consumer
protections
and
cardholder
perks
that
can
help
business
owners
save
money
and
protect
their
purchases.
If
you’re
in
the
market
for
a
new
business
credit
card,
Forbes
Advisor
created
this
guide
to
help
you
cut
through
the
hype
and
find
the
absolute
best
business
credit
card
for
your
needs
and
goals.

$50k

Just

When
considering
the
best

we
compared
not

the
various
earning
structures
but
the
overall
combination
of
benefits
each

offered.
We
went
through
dozens
of
options
and
considered
the
following
factors
when
it
came
time
to
cherry-pick
our
top
choices:
rewards
rate,
credit
card
fees,
ease
of
use,
welcome
offers

and
Drawbacks:

so
it’s
a
solid
choice

you

without
any
additional
cost
and

be
eligible
for
auto

on
vehicle
rentals
used
for
business
purposes,
purchase
protection,
extended
warranties
and
more
just

The
biggest

with

However,
you

it

a
better
deal
if

You’ll
get

If
your
business
expenses
vary
from
month
to
month,
look
to
a
card
like
the
U.S.

which
offers
elevated

in
your
top
two

categories
each
month,
automatically

where
you
spend
the
most.
And,
if
your
business
uses
U.S

to
process
credit
card
payments
from
your
customers
you
can
earn
additional
points
from
those
transactions.
Rewards:
Earn
2

per
dollar
spent
in
the
top
two
categories
from
a
list
of
48
where
you
spend
each

Benefits
and
Drawbacks:
There’s
no
need
to
opt-in

categories
or
track
where
you’re

will
automatically
adjust
to
how
you
spend.
Rewards
expire
five
years
from
the
day
on
which
they
were
earned,
which
can
be
cumbersome
to
track.
If
you
consistently
spend
heavily
in
more
than
two
categories,
you’ll
likely
fare
better
with
a
flat-rate
rewards
card.

Credit
Card
is
an
excellent
choice

either
buy
a
lot
from
the
online
store
or
spend
a
lot
on
the
Amazon
Web
Service
cloud
platform.
That’s
because
it
earns
high
rewards
on
spending
within
the
Amazon
ecosystem
and
decent
rewards
on
other
areas
of
spending
too.

yourself

But
if
your

the
bonus
categories
on
this
card,
or
you
simply
don’t
want
to
have
the

membership
required

option.
How
to
Choose
a
Business
Credit
Card
for
Cash
Back
Decide
whether
you
prefer
bonus
categories
or
flat-rate
rewards:
If
you
spend
a
lot
of
money
in
specific
categories
like
office
supply
stores
or
dining
each
year,
you
may
be
better
off
with
a
credit
card
that
offers
more
points
in
these
areas.
On
the
other
hand,
a
credit
card
that
offers
a
high
rate
of
flat-rate
rewards
may
help
you
earn
more
points
if
your
spending
is
spread
evenly
across
multiple
categories.
Compare
welcome
bonus
offers:
To
see
if
you
can
qualify
for
the
best
bonus
offers,
figure
out
how
much
your
business
spends
on
average
each
month.
From
there,
see
which
bonus
offers
fit
with
your
average
spending
style.
Look
for
cardholder
perks
you
want:
If
you’re
interested
in
credit
card
benefits
like
purchase
protection
or
extended
warranties
,
look
for
business
credit
cards
that
offer
these
perks.
Determine
how
you
want
to
redeem
your
rewards:
Business
cards
that
offer
cash
back
all
work
differently.
Some
only
let
you
redeem
for
statement
credits
or
a
check
in
the
mail,
while
others
let
you
cash
in
points
for
gift
cards,
travel,
merchandise
and
more.
Make
sure
any
cards
you’re
considering
offer
the
redemption
options
you
prefer.
Take
a
close
look
at
annual
fees:
Finally,
make
sure
to
compare
business
credit
cards
in
terms
of
their
annual
fees
and
other
fees.
While
paying
an
annual
fee
can
be
well
worth
it,
you
should
make
sure
you’re
getting
ample
rewards
and
cardholder
benefits
in
return.

Frequently
Asked
Questions
Which
credit
card
offers
the
highest
credit
limit?
Although
business
credit
cards
typically
offer
higher
credit
limits
than
personal
cards,
if
you’re
looking
for
the
highest
possible
limit
on
a
cash
back
business
credit
card,
know
that
the
limit
you’ll
actually
receive
will
depend
on
your
credit
profile
and
the
amount
of
business
revenue
you
claim
on
your
application. 
If
you
expect
that
you’ll
occasionally
need
to
spend
more
on
a
card
than
your
credit
limit,
consider
a
business
charge
card.
With
a
charge
card
you’ll
have
to
pay
the
balance
in
full
every
month,
unlike
a
credit
card
where
you
can
carry
a
balance.
A
charge
card
also
doesn’t
have
a
preset
spending
limit
which
means
you
won’t
have
to
worry
about
being
denied
for
a
large
purchase.
However,
the
issuer
will
use
your
spending
patterns
to
determine
an
upper
limit
on
the
amount
you
can
charge
at
any
one
time.

How
To
Get
A
Business
Credit
Card
Getting
a
cash
back
business
credit
card
is
similar
to
getting
any
other
type
of
credit
card.
Once
you’ve
identified
a
card
that
fits
your
business’
spending
habits,
you
can
apply.
A
business
credit
isn’t
limited
to
those
who
work
full-time
or
have
a
steady
established
business.
It’s
possible
to
get
a
cash
back
business
card
even
if
it’s
just
to
use
for
part-time
work,
a
freelance
position
or
an
occasional
side
gig.
How
To
Apply
For
A
Business
Credit
Card
Most
business
credit
cards
can
be
applied
for
online
or
in
some
cases
over
the
phone
or
in-branch
if
it’s
a
bank-issued
card. 
If
you
know
how
to
apply
for
a
personal
credit
card,
the
process
is
similar.
You’ll
have
to
provide
some
basic
information
including
your
business’
contact
details,
annual
revenue,
industry
type
and
number
of
employees.
You’ll
also
need
your
company’s
employee
identification
number
(EIN)
or,
if
you
don’t
have
one,
your
social
security
number. 
Be
aware
that
when
you
apply
for
a
business
credit
card,
you’re
personally
guaranteeing
that
you’ll
repay
the
debt,
just
like
you
would
for
a
personal
credit
card.
In
other
words,
if
your
business
goes
belly-up,
you’re
still
on
the
hook
for
any
balance
owed.
How
do
cash
back
business
credit
cards
work?
Every
time
you
make
a
purchase
with
your
cash
back
business
card,
you’ll
earn
a
percentage
back
on
your
spending.
The
amount
you’ll
earn
will
depend
on
your
particular
card’s
terms.
Those
earnings
are
accumulated
in
your
card’s
account
and
you
can
redeem
them
according
to
your
card’s
protocols.
Some
cards
let
you
redeem
your
cash
earnings
in
any
amount,
at
any
time
while
others
require
a
minimum
balance
to
cash
out. 
The
exact
way
you’ll
receive
your
cash
back
also
varies
by
card,
with
some
letting
you
take
those
rewards
as
a
statement
credit
against
your
balance
and
others
also
allowing
you
to
take
actual
cash
back.
Which
cash
back
credit
card
earns
the
most
cash
back?
There’s
no
one
best
cash
back
business
card
that
will
earn
the
most
rewards
for
everyone.
The
credit
card
that
will
earn
you
the
highest
cash
back
rewards
will
depend
on
your
business’
spending
habits
and
tolerance
for
tracking
rewards. 
For
example,
the
Ink
Business
Preferred®
Credit
Card
earns
3
Ultimate
Rewards
points
per
dollar
spent
on
the
first
$150,000
each
calendar
year
of
combined
purchases
on
travel,
shipping
purchases,
internet,
cable
and
phone
services
and
advertising
purchases
made
with
social
media
sites
and
search
engines.
All
other
spending
earns
1
point
per
dollar
spent.
If
these
categories
match
up
with
your
company’s
expenses,
the
rewards
can
really
add
up.
But
it
requires
tracking
your
spending
carefully. 
If
you
prefer
a
simple
cash
back
scheme,
a
card
that
earns
the
same
flat
rate
on
all
your
business
spending
could
be
a
better
fit.
Consider
the
Capital
One®
Spark®
Cash
for
Business
credit
card,
which
earns
2%
cash
back
on
everything
you
buy,
whether
it’s
desk
supplies
or
inventory.

Quote
of

Day

The
Forbes
Advisor
editorial
team
is
independent
and
objective.
To
help
support
our
reporting
work,
and
to
continue
our
ability
to
provide
this
content
for
free
to
our
readers,
we
receive
compensation
from
the
companies
that
advertise
on
the
Forbes
Advisor
site.
This
compensation
comes
from
two
main
sources.
First
,
we
provide
paid
placements
to
advertisers
to
present
their
offers.
The
compensation
we
receive
for
those
placements
affects
how
and
where
advertisers’
offers
appear
on
the
site.
This
site
does
not
include
all
companies
or
products
available
within
the
market.
Second,
we
also
include
links
to
advertisers’
offers
in
some
of
our
articles;
these
“affiliate
links”
may
generate
income
for
our
site
when
you
click
on
them.
The
compensation
we
receive
from
advertisers
does
not
influence
the
recommendations
or
advice
our
editorial
team
provides
in
our
articles
or
otherwise
impact
any
of
the
editorial
content
on
Forbes
Advisor.
While
we
work
hard
to
provide
accurate
and
up
to
date
information
that
we
think
you
will
find
relevant,
Forbes
Advisor
does
not
and
cannot
guarantee
that
any
information
provided
is
complete
and
makes
no
representations
or
warranties
in
connection
thereto,
nor
to
the
accuracy
or
applicability
thereof.
Here
is
a
list
of
our
partners
who
offer
products
that
we
have
affiliate
links
for.
