The
Covid-19
crisis
was
like
a
proverbial
whack
on
the
side
of
the
head,
getting
organizations
to
fly
right,
finally
focusing
their
energy
and
technology
to
where
it
counts
—
the
customer.
Can
it
last?
Salesforce’s
latest
survey
of
7,000
customer
service
executives
documents
the
aftermath
of
a
year
in
which
companies
suddenly
faced
a
reckoning:
to
reach
and
serve
customers
digitally,
or
not
at
all.
“Facing
a
sharply
different
environment
defined
by
shifting
business
models,
distributed
workforces,
and
a
host
of
new
and
evolving
customer
needs,
service
teams
are
facing
radically
new
standards
of
engagement,”
the
survey’s
authors
state.
“As
customers
spend
more
time
at
home
with
their
devices
and
less
time
in
stores
or
places
of
work,
the
shift
toward
digital
channels
has
accelerated.
At
the
same
time,
the
share
of
organizations
offering
in-person
customer
service
plummeted,
and
channels
such
as
online
chat,
messenger
apps,
and
video
support
saw
double-digit
adoption
gains.”
To
meet
these
requirements,
87%
of
service
professionals
say
customers
have
increased
their
use
of
digital
channels
during
the
pandemic,
and
78%
say
they
invested
in
new
technology
as
a
result
of
the
pandemic.
“A
new
digital-first
playbook
is
emerging,”
the
Salesforce
report
notes,
with
81%
of
decision
makers
accelerating
digital
initiatives.
Seventy-four
percent
of
decision
makers
say
they’re
more
reliant
on
data
than
before
the
Covid
crisis.
While
the
crisis
has
been
devastating,
it
opened
opportunities
for
companies
to
finally
expel
the
top-heavy
technology
baggage
they’ve
been
hauling
for
decades,
says
Neelan
Choksi
,
president
and
COO
at
Tasktop
Technologies
,
who
points
out
that
“Covid-19
magnified
what
organizations
have
to
prioritize.”
What
happened
over
the
past
12
months
is
a
shift
in
perspective
that
“puts
the
customer
at
the
center,
which
helps
transition
IT
organizations
from
an
internal,
project-
and
cost-centric
focus
to
a
product
operating
model.”
The
right
stuff,
of
course,
but
the
question
is,
can
this
hyper-focus
be
sustained
as
Covid
fades
and
the
world
moves
into
the
next
hard-charging,
IT-budget-busting
era?
Time
to
intensify
the
focus
on
“
value-stream
management
,”
Choksi
urges.
Value-stream
management
employs
lean
principles
to
connect
the
costs
and
results
of
software
development
and
delivery
to
what
customers
receive.
The
practice
focuses
on
“improving
the
end-to-end
time
it
takes
to
deliver
value
to
a
customer,”
he
explains,
offering
it
up
as
a
way
for
companies
to
“successfully
weather
accelerated
digital
transformation
and
better
compete
with
digital-native
companies.”

That’s
because
“being
an
IT
leader
today
is
not
just
about
IT––IT
is
the
business,"
Choksi
says.
"Software
is
the
new
currency
of
business.
It’s
evolution
and
natural
selection
—
software
is
still
eating
the
world
and
software-driven
businesses
are
eating
their
competitors.”
Shifting
IT
work
into
higher-value
work
requires
fundamental
changes
in
the
way
enterprises
think
about
project
management
versus
product
management,
he
continues.
“Tech
giants
have
been
successful
in
aligning
product
value
streams,
software
architecture
and
organizational
structure
to
innovate
at
a
pace
we
have
never
seen
before,”
says
Choksi.
“The
brought
the
benefits
of
cloud-native
delivery
right
to
their
business
models,
benefitting
not
only
from
the
services
in
cloud
solutions,
but
in
how
they
think,
plan
and
operate
from
a
business
strategy
and
economic
perspective.”
Again,
the
key
is
thinking
in
terms
of
product
management,
versus
project
management.
“Product
management
focuses
on
customer
needs
whereas
project
management
focuses
on
internal
milestones,”
Choksi.
“Success
in
project
management
means
you
have
executed
to
‘the
plan’
whereas
product
management
success
is
determined
by
a
happy
customer
—
which
sometimes
means
you
have
to
ignore
‘the
plan.’”
Moving
to
a
product-centric
approach
helps
executives
and
managers
“see
the
higher-order
benefits
of
moving
to
the
cloud
—
where
you
automate
repetitive
tasks,
look
for
opportunities
to
speed
delivery
and
get
faster
feedback
from
the
customer,”
he
says.
The
challenge
is
cutting
through
the
chaos
that
results
from
inefficient
collaboration,
a
lack
of
seamless
integration
between
tools,
and
built-up
“proxy
metrics,”
Choksi
says.
“For
business
leaders,
it’s
no
better,
because
even
if
you
solve
for
integration
and
corral
your
proxy
metrics,
most
of
software
development
still
needs
to
be
translated
to
business
outcomes.
With
relentless
pressure
from
the
business,
paired
with
increased
customer
demand
to
deliver
software
faster
than
ever,
we
need
to
better
facilitate
communication
between
the
business
and
IT.”
Greater
visualization
through
dashboards
can
help
facilitate
this
visibility,
he
adds.
Equally
important
is
business
counterparts
also
having
visibility
into
IT
activities.
“The
metrics
that
drive
successful
management
of
IT
teams
even
rolled
up
will
not
be
effective
for
IT
leaders
on
its
own,”
Choksi
says.
“IT
leaders
need
visibility
but
with
a
view
that
accounts
for
business
results
that
can
facilitate
their
conversations
with
their
business
leadership
and
pulled
up
and
abstracted
in
a
way
that
is
valuable
and
relevant
for
a
CIO
or
VP
level.
Because
IT
is
the
business,
departmental
activities
have
to
be
understood
by
both
sides.
Business
and
IT
need
to
be
speaking
the
same
language.”
