In

A
guide
to
the
responsible
use
of
AI
in
health
care
Leaders
from
all
sectors
of
health
care
are
increasingly
integrating
artificial
intelligence
(AI)
into
their
organizations
to
achieve
strategic
goals,
and
confidence
in
the
technology&#039;s
promise
is
growing.
A
2020
Optum
survey
on
AI
in
health
care
found
that
59%
of
respondents
expect
a
full
return
on
their
AI
investments
in
under
three
years,
nearly
double
the
31%
who
answered
similarly
in
2018.

and

The

may
unintentionally
perpetuate
harmful

directly
impact
a

In

to
overcome
these
challenges,
health

organizations
need
to
acknowledge
their

to

The
promise
of
open
clouds:
Faster
innovation,
faster
delivery
Apr

VentureBeat
x
Supermicro
and
Intel®
As
cloud
computing
continues
to
accelerate
worldwide,
organizations
are
now
deciding
which
model
best
serves
their
needs.
Yes,
the
major
public
clouds
can
offer
almost
unlimited
scalability,
but
users
are
limited
to
the
hardware
and
software
choices
the
cloud
provider
has
made.
This
is
where
open
clouds
come
in.
Consisting
of
&quot;open&quot;
components,
these
are
tailored
to
an
enterprise&#039;s
specific
needs
in
compute,
storage,
networking,
and
the
software
stack.
A
wide
range
of
&quot;instances&quot;
can
be
installed
in
an
open
data
center,
whether
made
available
to
internal
or
external
customers,
tailored
to
the
needs
of
the
enterprise.
As
a
result,
open
clouds
can
reduce
latencies
to
client
device
–
improving
customer
and
device
(IoT)
interactions.
The
latest
innovations
from
the
edge
to
the
data
center
can
be
quickly
brought
on-line,
and
tuned
to
the
exact
requirements
needed
to
maintain
SLAs.
But
in
making
the
best
decision,
you
need
to
ensure
three
main
components
for
success:
the
right
hardware
(the
primary
instruction
set
and
binary
compatibility);
the
best
software
stack;
and
the
appropriate
network
choice.
Join
this
VB
Live
event
to
learn
more
about
the
benefits
of
open
clouds
–
and
what’s
needed
to
produce
the
best
outcome.
Attendees
will
learn:
•
Why
an
eco-system
based
on
open
standards
can
reduce
costs
and
increase
innovation
•
How
to
evaluate
workloads
•
How
a
cloud
based
on
open
standards
can
easily
be
constructed
•
How
open
standards
apply
to
hardware
and
software
choices

encourage
continuous
and
repeat
game
play
as
players
compete
to
earn
status,
rewards,
and
prizes,
both
virtual
and
real.
Plus,
creating
a
global
community
with
competitive
game
play
through
an
esports
platform
enables
your
gamers
to
connect
and
play
together,
creating
the
kind
of
community
that
keeps
players
loyal.
In
this
VB

event,

you&#039;ll
hear
about

When

there&#039;s
no
such
thing
as

adapting
it
to
fit
the
unique
audience
demand
and
behavior
for

platform.
But
that

demographics,

behavior,

powerful
digital
marketing
strategy.
We&#039;ll
examine
best
practices
for
creative
in
every
channel
--
from
Facebook
to
Google
to
TikTok
to
Snapchat
(&amp;
more)
--
and
how
to
optimize
for
best
results.
You&#039;ll
find
out
how
to
make
native
ads
that
work
with
the
organic
content
on
each
platform,
implement
influencer
content
into
your
creative
assets
and
more.
Plus,
we&#039;ll
dive
into
real
examples
of
high-performing
creatives
across
platforms.
You&#039;ll
learn:
-
How
to
optimize
your
digital
marketing
strategy
through
creative
optimization
-
How
to
leverage
user
data
to
create
content
that

But
it&#039;s
not

money.
It&#039;s
a
tough
market,
where
new
games
are
proliferating,
advertising
is
shouting
for
gamers&#039;
attention,
and
attention

short.
At
the

consumers
are
more
concerned
than
ever
about
how
companies
are
using
and
sharing
their

propelling
data
privacy

to
the
forefront

the
industry’s
priorities.
Join
this

event
to
learn
how
data
changes
the
game
for
ads,
marketing,
user
acquisition
and
monetization.
Securely
leveraging
data
can
help
developers
cash
in
on
the
industry&#039;s
growth
opportunities,
attract
consumers,
create
optimized,
personalized
gaming
experiences,
protect
your
users’
privacy,
and
more.
Participants
will
learn
how
to:
●
Better
use
data
to
improve
the
effectiveness
of
ads
and
marketing
●
Make
data-driven
decisions
around
optimization
and

●
Overcome

on
how

racial
fairness
and
equity
while
building

with
AI,
ML,
and
large
data.
Evolve
bridges
two
of
the
most
significant
trends
in
the
corporate
world
in
2020.
First,
the
events
of
the
past
few
months
have
reawakened
the
world
to
continued
racial
injustice.
The
corporate
sector,
in
particular
the
technology
industry,
has
historically
been
perceived
as
slow
in
efforts
to
promote
equality
and
affirmative
action
in
the
workforce.
But
recent
events
have
spurred
them
into
action,
and
there
are
signs
that
real
change
could
come
about.
At
the
same
time,
machine
learning
(ML)
and
artificial
intelligence
(AI)
are
arguably
the
most
powerful
enterprise
technologies
today,
and
hundreds
of
large
companies
are
pushing
AI/ML
product
development
to
get
an
edge
on
their
competitors.
But
they
are
doing
so
at
a
time
when
many,
if
not
most,
of
the
decision-makers
do
not
reflect
the
diversity
of
the
general
population.
And
many
companies
have
been
careless
in
making
sure
their
data
used
in
AI
decision-making
is
not
reflecting
prejudice
and
bias
that
can
perpetuate
inequality
for
years
to
come.

When

But

The

choosing

As
the
COVID
pandemic
continues
to
evolve,
employees
are
struggling
under
the
weight
of
the
unknown.
From
the
stress
of
working
from
home
or
returning
to
an
office
environment
when
regulations
are
in
flux,
to
the
intense
pressure
on
employees
with
school-age
children
who
are
trying
to
juggle
work
and
impromptu
teaching,
workers
are
wrestling
with
hard
choices
and
difficult
issues.
The
scale
of
employee
mental
health
support
that
HR
and
business
leaders
must
provide
is
unprecedented.
In
this
webinar
presented
by
TriNet
and
FEI,
the
Workforce
Resilience
Experts,
you&#039;ll
learn
about
the
impact
that
COVID
is
having
on
employees&#039;
mental
health
and
productivity
—
and,
in
turn,
how
employees’
mental
health
impacts
the
health
of
a
company.
You’ll
learn
about
the
internal
strategies
organizations
need
now
to
support
employees,
from
adapting
communication
policies,
to
creating
buddy
systems
for
co-workers,
flexible
work
schedules,
and
more.
Registration
is
free!
You&#039;ll
learn:
-
What
employers
need
to
know
about
COVID’s
impact
on
the
mental
health
of
their
employees
-
How
the
mental
strain
of
COVID
may
negatively
impact
the
health
of
a
company

employee
productivity

What
it
takes
to
launch
a
mobile
game
internationally
Recorded:

VentureBeat
x

Mobile
gaming
is
a
global
billion
dollar
industry.
Its
meteoric
rise
is
fueled
by
growing
ad
revenues,
an
increase
in
gamer
participation
from
a
diverse
demographic,
and
investment
from
non-gaming
giants
from
entertainment
and
other
industries.
At
the
same
time,
the
advent
of
technologies
like
5G
and
increased
cloud
capabilities
are
expanding
mobile
game
appeal
and
accessibility.
The
next
step?
Launching
abroad.
Publishers
are
capitalizing
on
these
trends
by
expanding
their
reach
into
new,
lucrative
markets.
But
finding
success
means
overcoming
some
at-home
market
hurdles
like
foreign
government
regulations,
the
risk
of
market
saturation
and
competition,
and
the
spectre
of
slow
sales.
Such
hurdles
can
make
the
leap
to
cross-border
success
intimidating
—
but
there&#039;s
never
been
a
better
time
to
go
global.
For
insights
into
what
it
takes
for
American
publishers
to
build
an
international
audience
and
vice-versa,
the
strategies
that
developers
need
to
put
into
place,
and
how
to
mitigate
risk,
join
experts
from
Facebook
Audience
Network
in
this
VB
Live
event.
From
a
NA/LATAM
lens,
this
session
will
cover:
-
What
is
influencing
publisher
motivations
to
expand
internationally?
-
What
should
publishers
ask
themselves
when
looking
to
expand?
-
What
are
the
key
insights
and
trends
publishers
can
leverage
when
planning
to
expand?
