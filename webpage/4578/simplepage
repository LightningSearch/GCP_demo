A 2020 Optum survey on AI in health care found that 59% of respondents expect a full return on their AI investments in under three years, nearly double the 31% who answered similarly in 2018. Health care’s Quadruple Aim is to simultaneously improve health outcomes, enhance and simplify the experiences of both patients and providers, and reduce overall costs — and AI is seen as an integral tool to help achieve it. The risk is that predictive models may unintentionally perpetuate harmful racial and gender biases that directly impact a patient&#039;s health or access to care. In order to overcome these challenges, health care organizations need to acknowledge their existence—and take proactive steps to promote equity by examining both the data these models interpret and how the models are being applied. In this VB Live event, you&#039;ll learn more about how AI can help health care experts do their jobs more efficiently and effectively, and how stakeholders throughout health care can use AI responsibly, ethically, and equitably. Plus, you&#039;ll get an in-depth perspective on the strengths and limitations of data, AI methodology, the application of AI results, and more. - What it means to use advanced analytics &quot;responsibly&quot; - Why responsible use is so important in health care as compared to other fields - The steps that researchers and organizations are taking today to ensure AI is used responsibly - What the AI-enabled health system of the future looks like and its advantages for consumers, organizations, and clinicians Speakers: - Brian Christian, Author, The Alignment Problem, Algorithms to Live By and The Most Human Human - Sanji Fernando, SVP of Artificial Intelligence &amp; Analytics Platforms, Optum - Kyle Wiggers, AI Staff Writer, VentureBeat (moderator) ...more ...less Live online Mar 31 5:00 pm UTC or after on demand 60 mins Your place is confirmed, we'll send you email reminders Add to calendar Outlook iCal Google Register for free Presented by VentureBeat x Optum Watch later Presentation preview: Related topics: Artificial Intelligence Machine Learning Healthcare Quadruple Aim Data Analytics AI Methodology AI Bias Heathcare Technology Responsible Use more&hellip; Network with like-minded attendees More attendees 00004000 Remove Cancel Add a photo [[ session.user.profile.displayName ]] [[ session.user.profile.jobTitle ]] [[ session.user.profile.companyName ]] [[ userProfileTemplateHelper.getLocation(session.user.profile) ]] [[ card.displayName ]] [[ card.jobTitle ]] [[ card.companyName ]] [[ userProfileTemplateHelper.getLocation(card) ]] Hide me from other attendees Show me Channel Channel profile VentureBeat Up Down The promise of open clouds: Faster innovation, faster delivery Apr 27 2021 5:00 pm UTC 60 mins VentureBeat x Supermicro and Intel® As cloud computing continues to accelerate worldwide, organizations are now deciding which model best serves their needs. Yes, the major public clouds can offer almost unlimited scalability, but users are limited to the hardware and software choices the cloud provider has made. This is where open clouds come in. Consisting of &quot;open&quot; components, these are tailored to an enterprise&#039;s specific needs in compute, storage, networking, and the software stack. A wide range of &quot;instances&quot; can be installed in an open data center, whether made available to internal or external customers, tailored to the needs of the enterprise. As a result, open clouds can reduce latencies to client device – improving customer and device (IoT) interactions. The latest innovations from the edge to the data center can be quickly brought on-line, and tuned to the exact requirements needed to maintain SLAs. But in making the best decision, you need to ensure three main components for success: the right hardware (the primary instruction set and binary compatibility); the best software stack; and the appropriate network choice. Join this VB Live event to learn more about the benefits of open clouds – and what’s needed to produce the best outcome. Attendees will learn: • Why an eco-system based on open standards can reduce costs and increase innovation • How to evaluate workloads • How a cloud based on open standards can easily be constructed • How open standards apply to hardware and software choices Speakers: - Michael McNerney, Vice President Marketing and Network Security, Supermicro - More to come!

Evolve bridges two of the most significant trends in the corporate world in 2020. First, the events of the past few months have reawakened the world to continued racial injustice. The corporate sector, in particular the technology industry, has historically been perceived as slow in efforts to promote equality and affirmative action in the workforce. But recent events have spurred them into action, and there are signs that real change could come about. At the same time, machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) are arguably the most powerful enterprise technologies today, and hundreds of large companies are pushing AI/ML product development to get an edge on their competitors. But they are doing so at a time when many, if not most, of the decision-makers do not reflect the diversity of the general population. And many companies have been careless in making sure their data used in AI decision-making is not reflecting prejudice and bias that can perpetuate inequality for years to come.

Its meteoric rise is fueled by growing ad revenues, an increase in gamer participation from a diverse demographic, and investment from non-gaming giants from entertainment and other industries. At the same time, the advent of technologies like 5G and increased cloud capabilities are expanding mobile game appeal and accessibility. The next step? Launching abroad. Publishers are capitalizing on these trends by expanding their reach into new, lucrative markets. But finding success means overcoming some at-home market hurdles like foreign government regulations, the risk of market saturation and competition, and the spectre of slow sales. Such hurdles can make the leap to cross-border success intimidating — but there&#039;s never been a better time to go global. For insights into what it takes for American publishers to build an international audience and vice-versa, the strategies that developers need to put into place, and how to mitigate risk, join experts from Facebook Audience Network in this VB Live event.
