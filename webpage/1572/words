Cybersecurity
is
the
way
in
which
systems,
networks,
and
programs
utilize
technologies,
processes,
and
practices
to
protect
against
digital
attacks.
Cyberattacks
often
target
sensitive
information
and
data,
and
by
gaining
access
to
this
data,
cyber
criminals
extort
money
from
users
and
companies,
interrupt
normal
processes,
and
take
down
entire
sites.
Effective
cybersecurity
is
a
crucial
component
to
any
business,
and
even
more
is
at
stake
for
small-
and
medium-sized
organizations,
as
they
often
lack
the
resources
to
recover
from
such
attacks.
In
our
modern
data-driven
world,
protecting
against
cyber-attacks
is
becoming
increasingly
challenging
due
to
the
growing
amount
of
data
and
devices
available.
Why
is
Cybersecurity
Important?
Cybersecurity
is
one
of
the
most
important
aspects
of
any
business
today.
This
is
because
governments,
financial
corporations,
medical
companies,
and
virtually
every
other
entity
collects
and
stores
massive
amounts
of
data
on
computers
and
devices.
Much
of
this
data
contains
sensitive
information
about
these
companies
or
the
public,
such
as
intellectual
property,
financial
data,
personal
details,
and
much
more.
This
data
is
also
often
transferred
across
networks
and
through
devices,
meaning
there
are
many
opportunities
for
it
to
be
compromised.
The
world
has
witnessed
many
large-scale
cyber-attacks,
which
have
led
to
a
constant
increase
in
public
mistrust
for
the
handling
of
their
data.
These
types
of
attacks
also
severely
damage
the
companies’
reputations.
Here
is
a
look
at
some
of
the
biggest
cyber-attacks
in
recent
history:
Adobe:
In
October
2013,
hackers
hit
Adobe
and
the
original
reporting
said
around
3
million
encrypted
customer
credit
card
records
and
login
data
for
other
users
was
stolen.
However,
that
estimate
kept
increasing
with
the
impact
reaching
153
million
user
records.
The
company
settled
for
$1.1
million
in
legal
fees
and
an
undisclosed
amount
to
users.
Equifax:
In
July
2017,
Equifax
suffered
a
major
data
breach
that
exposed
around
147.9
million
consumers.
Information
like
Social
Security
numbers,
birth
dates,
addresses,
and
drivers’
license
numbers
were
compromised,
and
as
one
of
the
largest
credit
bureaus
in
the
US,
the
company
faced
severe
scrutiny
for
security
and
response
lapses.
Sina
Weibo: 
In
one
of
the
more
recent
examples,
China’s
Sina
Weibo,
which
is
the
nation’s
alternative
to
Twitter,
suffered
a
breach
in
March
2020.
Around
172
million
users’
real
names,
site
usernames,
gender,
location,
and
phone
numbers
had
been
put
up
for
sale
on
dark
web
markets.
An
Effective
Cybersecurity
Strategy
 
There
are
a
few
crucial
components
to
an
effective
cybersecurity
strategy
that
will
allow
any
organization
to
protect
all
of
its
processes.
It
is
especially
vital
for
companies
to
keep
up
with
the
constantly
evolving
digital
environments
and
the
security
risks
within
it,
as
new
tools
are
being
developed
at
a
rapid
pace,
both
for
companies
and
cybercriminals.
Before
this
current
environment,
companies
often
focused
on
their
most
crucial
systems,
but
now
they
must
take
a
more
proactive
approach
that
involves
continuous
monitoring
and
upscaling.
Here
is
a
look
at
some
of
the
fundamental
components
of
an
effective
cybersecurity
strategy
and
what
each
one
involves:
Network
security:
Protecting
the
network
against
attacks,
breaches,
and
unwanted
users.
Application
security:
Ensuring
that
all
apps
are
up-to-date
and
tested
to
protect
against
security
attacks.
Endpoint
security:
Protecting
remote
access
to
an
organization’s
network.
Data
security:
A
separate
layer
for
protecting
company
and
customer
data
inside
networks
and
applications.
Database
and
infrastructure
security:
Protecting
databases
and
physical
equipment.
Cloud
security:
One
of
the
more
challenging
aspects
of
cybersecurity
that
involves
protecting
data
in
the
fully
digital
environment.
Identity
management:
Controlling
which
individuals
have
access
to
an
organization.
Mobile
security:
With
the
increase
in
mobile
devices,
security
of
cell
phones,
tablets,
and
other
devices
are
an
increased
security
challenge.
Recovery:
Following
a
breach,
natural
disaster,
or
other
data
event,
it
is
crucial
for
an
organization
to
have
a
recovery
plan.
Types
of
Cybersecurity
Threats
There
are
a
few
main
types
of
cybersecurity
threats
any
individual
and
organization
should
be
aware
of:
Phishing:
Phishing
attacks
involve
fraudulent
emails
that
look
as
if
they
come
from
reputable
sources.
The
most
common
type
of
cyber-attack,
phishing
can
steal
sensitive
information
like
credit
card
numbers
and
login
credentials.
Solutions
include
awareness
training
or
a
technology
that
filters
these
emails.
Ransomware:
Ransomware
is
a
type
of
malicious
software
that
aims
to
extort
money
by
restricting
access
to
files
or
the
computer
system
until
its
paid.
However,
payment
does
not
mean
the
system
will
be
restored,
or
files
will
be
recovered.
Malware:
Malware
is
a
type
of
software
that
aims
to
gain
access
to
a
computer
and
cause
damage.
Social
engineering:
Social
engineering
is
a
tactic
that
aims
to
reveal
sensitive
information
by
soliciting
monetary
payments
or
gaining
access
to
confidential
data.
Social
engineering
is
often
combined
with
other
threats
to
increase
effectiveness.
Cyber
security
is
one
of
the
most
vital
aspects
of
any
business
in
today’s
age,
and
it
should
be
implemented
top-down,
with
corporate
management
leading
the
way.
There
must
be
continuous
adaptation
as
this
area
is
constantly
changing
and
becoming
an
increasing
threat.
Perhaps
just
as
important
as
the
actual
cybersecurity
technology
are
the
employees,
which
through
education,
awareness,
and
a
security-focused
approach
are
the
best
defense
against
any
attack.
For
small-
to
medium-sized
companies,
it
is
important
to
begin
with
the
most
critical
business
processes
and
scale
up
from
there.
