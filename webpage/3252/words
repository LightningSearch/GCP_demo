Loft's
founders,
Mate
Pencz
and
Florian
Hagenbuch:
IPO
and
international
expansion
in
the
horizon
Loft
São
Paulo-based
real
estate
marketplace
Loft
has
reached
a
$2.2
billion
valuation
after
raising
$425
million
in
a
Series
D
round
aimed
at
widening
its
footprint
across
Brazil,
fueling
acquisitions
and
moving
faster
towards
international
expansion
and
an
IPO.
The
round
was
led
by
D1
Capital
Partners
,
a
hedge
fund
investing
in
the
likes
of
SpaceX
,
Squarespace
and
Instacart
.
Other
new
investors
joining
the
company's
fourth
investment
round
include
Advent
International,
Altimeter
Capital,
CPPIB,
DST
Global,
GIC,
Silver
Lake
Waterman,
Tarsadia
Capital,
and
Tiger
Global
.
The
pool
of
new
backers
also
includes
Emerging
Variant
,
the
hedge
fund
led
by
former
money
manager
at
George
Soros
's
family
office,
Santiago
Jariton
.
Moreover,
existing
investors
Andreessen
Horowitz,
Caffeinated
Capital,
Fifth
Wall
Ventures,
Monashees,
QED
Investors,
Vulcan
Capital
and
Zigg
Capital
have
also
joined
the
round.
According
to
cofounder
and
co-CEO
of
the
company,
Mate
Pencz
,
the
company
had
a
fair
amount
of
its
previous
$175
million
Series
C
round
announced
in
January
2020,
still
in
the
bank.
However,
the
Covid-19
pandemic
accelerated
the
firm's
strategy
of
bringing
the
e-commerce
experience
to
real
estate
-
and
the
attention
of
investors:
"We'd
been
building
our
online
capabilities
and
consumers
were
already
using
these
tools
and
products.
But
they
had
less
applicability
in
the
pre
pandemic
world
than
in
the
post
Covid
world,"
the
entrepreneur
said.
"The
acceleration
seen
in
the
general
e-commerce
spaceover
the
last
few
months
was
the
realization
of
our
thesis,
to
bring
a
a
new
solution
for
the
real
estate
market
that
would
end
the
pain
[of
the
home
buying
and
selling
process]."
<fbs-ad
position="inread"

ad-id="article-0-inread"
aria-hidden="true"
role="presentation">
"We
were
very
well
positioned
at
the
end
of
2020,
and
started
drawing
the
attention
of
several
funds
and
investors,
who
until
then
had
not
paid
so
much
attention
to
our
thesis",
he
added.
The
founder
is
referring
to
the
company's
belief
that
the
process
of
buying
or
selling
property
online
would
become
just
as
straightforward
as
buying
groceries
on
the
Internet
-
according
to
Pencz,
Brazilians
currently
have
to
go
through
over
190
steps
from
the
start
of
the
journey
with
visits
to
the
property,
until
its
conclusion,
with
the
deed
registration.

The
Company’s
Virtual-First
Healthcare
Offering
The
Six
Biggest
Blockchain
Trends
Everyone
Should
Know
About
In
2021
By
offering
an
end-to-end
digital
experience,
the
firm
has
seen
a
28-fold
increase
in
business
in
2020
in
relation
to
the
prior
year
and
the
client
base
went
from
85
in
2019
to
2,500
last
year.
The
growth
is
part
due
to
the
introduction
of
the
marketplace,
as
well
as
the
iBuyer
model,
whereby
the
company
buys
and
renovates
properties
before
selling
them.
"People
already
bought
things
via
e-commerce,
but
mostly
smaller,
recurring
items.
Now,
the
digitalization
trend
will
mean
that
e-commerce
will
serve
all
types
of
physical
goods,
and
this
is
extending
to
the
real
estate
market
as
well",
Pencz
noted.
According
to
the
entrepreneur,
Loft's
latest
valuation
could
have
been
"a
lot
higher"
and
its
Series
D
round
was
the
most
sought-after
round
in
the
startup's
history.
"We
managed
to
create
a
syndicate
of
funds
that
complement
each
other.
We
have
two
of
the
largest
pension
and
sovereign
funds,
as
well
as
some
of
the
biggest
publicly
traded
and
private
equity
funds
in
the
world",
said
the
cofounder,
adding
that
investors
felt
safer
this
time
around.
"In
the
last
three
investment
rounds,
in
a
way,
[Loft]
still
had
a
lot
more
risk
around
execution
and
market-fit.
[Investors
could
ask],
'will
this
company
be
successful?'.
Those
uncertainties
no
longer
existed
in
the
latest
round",
he
added.
According
to
Pencz,
a
Hungarian
entrepreneur
who
founded
the
real
estate
company
along
with
his
German
friend
Florian
Hagenbuch
in
2018,
the
vision
of
e-commerce
principles
applied
to
real
estate
is
what
attracted
the
slew
of
new
investors.
"In
just
a
few
years,
we
have
managed
to
become
leaders
in
our
segment
in
Latin
America:
we
are
also
the
largest
[real
estate
marketplace]
in
the
world
outside
China
and
the
United
States",
Pencz
argued.
"Most
of
these
[new
investors]
don't
tend
to
back
private
companies;
they
usually
go
for
publicly
listed
businesses",
the
founder
pointed
out,
adding
that
the
new
backers
expect
Loft
will
also
go
public
in
a
medium
to
long-term
horizon.
With
the
new
cash,
the
company
will
be
focusing
on
improving
the
customer
experience
in
its
digital
marketplace
and
focus
on
density,
so
having
as
many
properties
available
to
show
customers
in
the
cities
where
its
operates
as
possible.
The
startup
also
plans
on
expanding
beyond
São
Paulo
and
Rio
de
Janeiro,
where
it
already
operates
with
15,000
properties
listed.
"If
the
[property
buying
and
selling
process]
had
less
friction,
people
would
move
around
more.
We
know
from
our
own
research
that
everyone
who
lives
in
Brazil
has
horrific
anecdotal
experiences
of
how
complex
the
experience
of
moving
was",
Pencz
argued.
"With
this
experience
becoming
more
efficient,
as
we
see
in
more
developed
markets
the
market
become
more
dynamic,
people
move
more,
and
end
up
living
less
time
in
suboptimal
conditions."
In
addition,
the
idea
is
to
use
the
new
cash
for
acquisitions.
In
its
short
history,
the
company
acquired
property
renovations
startup
Decorati
,
as
well
as
credit
platform
Investmais
,
and
Nomah
,
a
company
focusing
on
short-term
rentals,
which
has
received
a
BRL
50
million
($9
million)
funding
from
its
parent
company
earlier
this
month.
"We
now
have
resources
to
make
larger
acquisitions
and
are
constantly
assessing
the
market",
said
Pencz,
who
alongside
his
cofounder
also
runs
Canary
,
a
fund
which
has
raised
$120
million
for
early-stage
investments
since
its
inception
in
2018.
Loft
also
has
international
ambitions.
Pencz
and
Hagenbuch
are
second-time
entrepreneurs
in
Brazil
-
the
duo
founded
online
printing
services
firm
Printi
in
2012;
according
to
Pencz,
the
idea
the
friends
started
doing
business
in
Latin
America
was
that
it
was
"time
for
someone
to
set
up
a
company
in
Brazil
with
global
ambitions."
"Nobody
thought
about
it
much
back
then,
but
now
with
[Brazil-born]
companies
like
Nubank
,
Gympass
and
others,
we
are
seeing
that
this
is
possible
-
and
it
is
happening",
the
entrepreneur
said.
"We
have
a
lot
of
homework
to
do
and
need
to
consolidate
our
presence
in
Brazil,
but
it
will
be
a
logical
step
to
grow
in
some
capitals
outside
Brazil,
in
Latin
America,
and
eventually
even
outside
the
continent."
