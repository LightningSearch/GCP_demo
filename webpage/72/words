Building

The
Challenge
İşbank
wanted
to
create
a
robust
virtual
assistant
in
Turkish,
with
the
ability
to
support
multi-turn
use
cases
like
bill
payment
and
money
transfer.
İşbank
struggled
to
find
a
vendor
that
could
accommodate
the
Turkish
language
and
also
provide
a
platform
that
gave
them
the
freedom
to
build
complex
use
cases
with
contextual
awareness.
The
Solution
İşbank
leveraged
the
Clinc
AI
Platform
to
conduct
a
rapid
cycle
of
designing,
building,
and
deploying
conversational
AI.
Using
Clinc’s
technology,
Maxi
was
trained
to
understand
and
respond
both
in
written
and
spoken
format
in
Turkish.
Powered
by
advanced
natural
language
processing,
machine
learning,
and
deep
neural
networks,
Clinc’s
AI
is
able
to
comprehend,
recall,
and
respond
to
unstructured,
everyday
human
speech.
After
only
6
months
of
building
and
2
months
of
roll-out,
the
Turkish
virtual
assistant
was
deployed
to
all
8.2
million
İşbank
mobile
app
users.
The
assistant,
Maxi,
supports
basic
transactions
like
bill
payment
and
money
transfer,
as
well
as
complex
personal
financial
management
(PFM)
queries
like
spending
advice
and
more
with
enriched
visuals.
