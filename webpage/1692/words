Machine
learning
is
one
of
the
quickest
growing
technological
fields,
but
despite
how
often
the
words
“machine
learning”
are
tossed
around,
it
can
be
difficult
to
understand
what
machine
learning
is,
precisely.
Machine
learning
doesn’t
refer
to
just
one
thing,
it&#8217;s
an
umbrella
term
that
can
be
applied
to
many
different
concepts
and
techniques.
Understanding
machine
learning
means
being
familiar
with
different
forms
of
model
analysis,
variables,
and
algorithms.
Let’s
take
a
close
look
at
machine
learning
to
better
understand
what
it
encompasses.
What
Is
Machine
Learning?
While
the
term
machine
learning
can
be
applied
to
many
different
things,
in
general,
the
term
refers
to
enabling
a
computer
to
carry
out
tasks
without
receiving
explicit
line-by-line
instructions
to
do
so.
A
machine
learning
specialist
doesn’t
have
to
write
out
all
the
steps
necessary
to
solve
the
problem
because
the
computer
is
capable
of
“learning”
by
analyzing
patterns
within
the
data
and
generalizing
these
patterns
to
new
data.
Machine
learning
systems
have
three
basic
parts:
Inputs
Algorithms
Outputs
The
inputs
are
the
data
that
is
fed
into
the
machine
learning
system,
and
the
input
data
can
be
divided
into
labels
and
features.
Features
are
the
relevant
variables,
the
variables
that
will
be
analyzed
to
learn
patterns
and
draw
conclusions.
Meanwhile,
the
labels
are
classes/descriptions
given
to
the
individual
instances
of
the
data.
Features
and
labels
can
be
used
in
two
different
types
of
machine
learning
problems:
supervised
learning
and
unsupervised
learning
.
Unsupervised
vs.
Supervised
Learning
In
supervised
learning
,
the
input
data
is
accompanied
by
a
ground
truth.
Supervised
learning
problems
have
the
correct
output
values
as
part
of
the
dataset,
so
the
expected
classes
are
known
in
advance.
This
makes
it
possible
for
the
data
scientist
to
check
the
performance
of
the
algorithm
by
testing
the
data
on
a
test
dataset
and
seeing
what
percentage
of
items
were
correctly
classified.
In
contrast,
unsupervised
learning
problems
do
not
have
ground
truth
labels
attached
to
them.
A
machine
learning
algorithm
trained
to
carry
out
unsupervised
learning
tasks
must
be
able
to
infer
the
relevant
patterns
in
the
data
for
itself.
Supervised
learning
algorithms
are
typically
used
for
classification
problems,
where
one
has
a
large
dataset
filled
with
instances
that
must
be
sorted
into
one
of
many
different
classes.
Another
type
of
supervised
learning
is
a
regression
task,
where
the
value
output
by
the
algorithm
is
continuous
in
nature
instead
of
categorical.
Meanwhile,
unsupervised
learning
algorithms
are
used
for
tasks
like
density
estimation,
clustering,
and
representation
learning.
These
three
tasks
need
the
machine
learning
model
to
infer
the
structure
of
the
data,
there
are
no
predefined
classes
given
to
the
model.
Let’s
take
a
brief
look
at
some
of
the
most
common
algorithms
used
in
both
unsupervised
learning
and
supervised
learning.
Types
of
Supervised
Learning
Common
supervised
learning
algorithms
include:
Naive
Bayes
Support
Vector
Machines
Logistic
Regression
Random
Forests
Artificial
Neural
Networks
Support
Vector
Machines
are
algorithms
that
divide
up
a
dataset
into
different
classes.
Data
points
are
grouped
into
clusters
by
drawing
lines
that
separate
the
classes
from
one
another.
Points
found
on
one
side
of
the
line
will
belong
to
one
class,
while
the
points
on
the
other
side
of
the
line
are
a
different
class.
Support
Vector
Machines
aim
to
maximize
the
distance
between
the
line
and
the
points
found
on
either
side
of
the
line,
and
the
greater
the
distance
the
more
confident
the
classifier
is
that
the
point
belongs
to
one
class
and
not
another
class.
Logistic
Regression
is
an
algorithm
used
in
binary
classification
tasks
when
data
points
need
to
be
classified
as
belonging
to
one
of
two
classes.
Logistic
Regression
works
by
labeling
the
data
point
either
a
1
or
a
0.
If
the
perceived
value
of
the
data
point
is
0.49
or
below,
it
is
classified
as
0,
while
if
it
is
0.5
or
above
it
is
classified
as
1.
Decision
Tree
algorithms
operate
by
dividing
datasets
up
into
smaller
and
smaller
fragments.
The
exact
criteria
used
to
divide
the
data
is
up
to
the
machine
learning
engineer,
but
the
goal
is
to
ultimately
divide
the
data
up
into
single
data
points,
which
will
then
be
classified
using
a
key.
A
Random
Forest
algorithm
is
essentially
many
single
Decision
Tree
classifiers
linked
together
into
a
more
powerful
classifier.
The
Naive
Bayes
Classifier
calculates
the
probability
that
a
given
data
point
has
occurred
based
on
the
probability
of
a
prior
event
occurring.
It
is
based
on
Bayes
Theorem
and
it
places
the
data
points
into
classes
based
on
their
calculated
probability.
When
implementing
a
Naive
Bayes
classifier,
it
is
assumed
that
all
the
predictors
have
the
same
influence
on
the
class
outcome.
An
Artificial
Neural
Network
,
or
multi-layer
perceptron,
are
machine
learning
algorithms
inspired
by
the
structure
and
function
of
the
human
brain.
Artificial
neural
networks
get
their
name
from
the
fact
that
they
are
made
out
of
many
nodes/neurons
linked
together.
Every
neuron
manipulates
the
data
with
a
mathematical
function.
In
artificial
neural
networks,
there
are
input
layers,
hidden
layers,
and
output
layers.
The
hidden
layer
of
the
neural
network
is
where
the
data
is
actually
interpreted
and
analyzed
for
patterns.
In
other
words,
it
is
where
the
algorithm
learns.
More
neurons
joined
together
make
more
complex
networks
capable
of
learning
more
complex
patterns.
Types
of
Unsupervised
Learning
Unsupervised
Learning
algorithms
include:
K-means
clustering
Autoencoders
Principal
Component
Analysis
K-means
clustering
is
an
unsupervised
classification
technique,
and
it
works
by
separating
points
of
data
into
clusters
or
groups
based
on
their
features.
K-means
clustering
analyzes
the
features
found
in
the
data
points
and
distinguishes
patterns
in
them
that
make
the
data
points
found
in
a
given
class
cluster
more
similar
to
each
other
than
they
are
are
to
clusters
containing
the
other
data
points.
This
is
accomplished
by
placing
possible
centers
for
the
cluster,
or
centroids,
in
a
graph
of
the
data
and
reassigning
the
position
of
the
centroid
until
a
position
is
found
that
minimizes
the
distance
between
the
centroid
and
the
points
that
belong
to
that
centroid’s
class.
The
researcher
can
specify
the
desired
number
of
clusters.
Principal
Component
Analysis
is
a
technique
that
reduces
large
numbers
of
features/variables
down
into
a
smaller
feature
space/fewer
features.
The
“principal
components”
of
the
data
points
are
selected
for
preservation,
while
the
other
features
are
squeezed
down
into
a
smaller
representation.
The
relationship
between
the
original
data
potions
is
preserved,
but
since
the
complexity
of
the
data
points
is
simpler,
the
data
is
easier
to
quantify
and
describe.
Autoencoders
are
versions
of
neural
networks
that
can
be
applied
to
unsupervised
learning
tasks.
Autoencoders
are
capable
of
taking
unlabeled,
free-form
data
and
transforming
them
into
data
that
a
neural
network
is
capable
of
using,
basically
creating
their
own
labeled
training
data.
The
goal
of
an
autoencoder
is
to
convert
the
input
data
and
rebuild
it
as
accurately
as
possible,
so
it&#8217;s
in
the
incentive
of
the
network
to
determine
which
features
are
the
most
important
and
extract
them.
