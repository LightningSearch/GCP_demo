F
rom
automotive
manufacturers
to
locally-owned
yoga
studios,
in
the
past
year,
organizations
of
all
sizes
in
seemingly
every
industry
have
embraced
virtual
events
and
webinars
to
reach
their
audience.
In
an
annual
study
by
HubSpot
and
Wyzol,
62%
of
marketers
said
they
leveraged
webinars
in
2020,
compared
to
only
46%
the
year
previous.
What’s
more
impressive:
91%
of
these
marketers
say
their
webinars
were
a
success,
sealing
its
rank
as
one
of
the
most
effective
video
marketing
channels.
With
COVID-19
continuing
to
pose
significant
challenges
related
to
planning
in-person
events
in
2021,
modern
virtual
events
are
enabling
both
B2B
and
B2C
marketers
to
confidently
plan
for
the
year
ahead.
However,
this
sudden
surge
in
virtual
event
popularity
–
coupled
with
the
subsequent
rise
of
“Zoom
fatigue”
–
means
brands
need
to
go
beyond
simply
screen-sharing
a
slide
presentation
to
attract
and
keep
audiences
engaged.
Maximize
the
success
of
your
virtual
event
in
2021
with
these
three
tips:
1.
Start
planning
early.
Simply
put:
You
need
to
dedicate
the
same
time,
care
and
commitment
to
planning
your
virtual
event
as
you
would
an
in-person
event.
In
a
study
by
ON24,
69%
of
marketers
said
they
begin
planning
webinars
at
least
three
months
in
advance.
There’s
plenty
to
consider
when
planning
a
virtual
event,
from
identifying
and
preparing
your
SMEs
and
spokespeople
to
attracting
attendees
with
effective
marketing
–
not
to
mention
your
technology
stack
and
designing
promotional
assets.
Before
you
begin
planning,
organize
a
kick-off
meeting
with
key
decision
makers
who
have
a
stake
in
the
success
of
your
event,
such
as
the
heads
of
your
sales,
marketing
and
PR
departments.
Compile
a
list
of
considerations
spanning
from
platform
to
presenters
to
help
guide
that
pre-planning
session
–
as
well
as
determine
who
needs
to
be
in
attendance!
2.
Make
it
interactive.
Ultimately,
audience
interaction
is
what
will
define
the
success
of
your
virtual
event
–
and
differentiate
the
experience
from
a
static
video
feed.
Your
virtual
event
or
webinar
should
invite
the
audience
to
be
an
active
attendee,
not
just
a
passive
viewer.
Think
back
to
your
brand’s
past
experiences
at
in-person
events
to
identify
opportunities
to
recreate
your
most
valuable
audience
interactions.
For
example,
brands
that
previously
hosted
promotional
training
courses
or
workshops
to
reach
prospective
buyers
may
consider
using
live
polls
to
help
guide
their
virtual
presentation
in
real
time.
This
allows
presenters
to
focus
on
the
specific
content
their
audiences
want
–
as
well
as
keep
them
engaged
throughout
the
presentation.
3.
Don’t
forget
the
follow
up.
After
your
event,
maximize
your
success
by
sealing
the
deal
with
strong
follow-up
communications,
most
commonly
via
email.
Start
by
segmenting
your
email
list
according
to
attendees
and
no-shows
to
tailor
your
messaging.
If
possible
and
appropriate,
send
a
URL
to
the
session
recording
available
on-demand
to
both
lists.
For
those
who
didn’t
attend,
include
a
short
session
description,
as
well
as
details
on
how
they
can
reach
out
with
any
questions
they
may
have.
For
attendees,
consider
creating
supplemental
materials
like
downloadable
guides
or
case
studies
to
continue
sharing
great
content
related
to
your
virtual
event,
paired
with
strategic
messaging
that
encourages
audiences
to
take
the
next
step
in
engaging
with
your
brand.
With
fewer
opportunities
to
connect
with
audiences
at
in-person
events,
conferences
or
trade
shows,
virtual
events
and
webinars
allow
brands
to
take
an
intentional
and
predictable
approach
to
shifting
their
event
marketing
strategy
in
2021.
