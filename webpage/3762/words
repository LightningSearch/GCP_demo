With
Finovate
making
its
debut
on
the
European
continent
just
over
a
month
from
now,
we
thought
it
was
a
good
time
to
catch
up
with
one
of
the
major
fintech
innovators
in
the
region,
banqUP
.
The
company,
headquartered
in
Belgium
and
&#8220;proudly
developed
in
Poland,&#8221;
demonstrated
its
small
business
banking
platform
at
FinovateEurope
2017.
We
reached
out
to
company
CEO
and
founder
Krzysztof
Pulkiewicz
to
talk
about
banqUP&#8217;s
latest
accomplishments
in
open
banking,
as
well
as
what
the
landscape
for
fintech
innovation
is
like
inside
and
outside
the
CEE
region.
Finovate:
The
most
recent
news
from
banqUP
is
the
news
of
your
AIS
license
from
the
Polish
Financial
Supervision
Authority.
What
does
this
license
enable
and
how
important
was
this
development
to
your
company?
Krzysztof
Pulkiewicz:
It
allows
us
to
broaden
our
reach
and
gain
new
clients.
We
have
been
working
with
a
number
of
banks
but
now,
with
our
newly
gained
license,
we
have
the
possibility
to
work
both
with
banks
and
other
entities
that
can
gain
access
to
the
opportunities
provided
by
open
banking
thanks
to
our
solutions.
Finovate:
You
also
recently
announced
that
the
company
will
focus
fully
on
its
B2B2C
open
banking
platform.
Can
you
tell
us
a
little
bit
about
the
thinking
behind
this
decision?
Pulkiewicz:
For
banqUP,
the
main
reasons
of
moving
from
an
idea
of
a
fintech
bank
to
a
platform
integrating
banking
APIs
were
challenges
related
to
the
acquisition
of
customers,
especially
on
mature
digital
banking
markets
like
Poland.
There
were
also
several
limitations
like
opening
accounts
in
polish
zloty.
On
the
other
hand,
we
were
already
closely
working
with
banks
interested
in
our
technology.
We
have
seen
that
a
number
of
our
partners
were
interested
in
our
open
banking
solutions.
We
have
been
working
in
a
sort
of
a
schizophrenic
environment
&#8211;
both
working
with
banks
and
building
our
own
bank
as
well.
Multibanking
was
a
core
element
of
banqUP
fintech
bank
from
day
one,
and
we
have
decided
to
focus
on
this
aspect
of
the
platform.
We
knew
that
sticking
to
what
we
are
really
good
at
&#8211;
technology
and
data
analytics
&#8211;
will
be
working
for
us.
And
it
proved
true.
banqUp&#8217;s
platform
adds
new
functionality
such
as
analytics
and
data
enrichment
in
addition
to
data
aggregation.
Finovate:
In
line
with
this,
the
company
has
decided
to
launch
a
TPP-as-a-Service
business
line.
Why
do
this
and
how
large
are
the
opportunities
there?
Pulkiewicz:
This
is
something
we
have
been
thinking
about
since
we
have
started
considering
open
banking.
Multibanking
solutions
are
the
beginning
of
the
open
banking
ecosystem,
but
we
are
sure
that
what
the
future
brings,
are
the
new
ideas
and
products
that
will
come
from
PSD2.
There
are
many
companies
that
do
not
consider
getting
their
TPP
licenses,
as
it
is
not
a
core
of
their
business.&nbsp;
However,
they
are
willing
to
use
the
information
provided
by
the
banking
system,
and
our
solution
is
created
for
such
partners.
The
number
of
inquiries
we
are
getting
from
prospective
partners
is
really
astonishing
&#8211;
and
these
are
both
new
companies
and
major
players
from
different
industries.&nbsp;
Finovate:
You
mentioned
in
an
email
that
you
plan
to
open
the
next
generation
of
your
platform
to
the
public
early
next
year.
Can
you
give
us
a
preview
of
what’s
new
and
what
to
expect
–
as
well
as
any
update
on
the
timeline?
Pulkiewicz:
Our
main
focus
is
on
what
we
call
“open
banking
building
blocks.”
We
are
extending
our
platform
with
best-in-class
API
and
SDK
that
will
offer
effective
integration
capabilities
for
developers.
On
the
functional
level,
we
are
adding
new
functionalities
on
top
of
data
aggregation
(analytics,
data
quality
management,
and
data
enrichment)
as
well
as
provide
and
expand
on
all
the
components
that
can
support
different
businesses
in
connecting
to
the
open-banking
world
(consent
lifecycle
management,
data
streaming,
combining
PSD2
APIs
with
other
data
sources).
We
know
that
data
aggregation
and
payment
initiation
is
just
a
starting
point
and
we
are
positioning
our
platform
as
a
one-stop
shop
for
open
banking.
The
team
from
banqUP
during
their
live
demonstration
at
FinovateEurope
2017.
Finovate:
BanqUp
operates
in
both
CEE
and
non-CEE
Europe
–
Poland,
Slovakia,
Hungary,
and
Bulgaria
on
the
one
hand,
Belgium
and
Ireland
on
the
other.
Are
there
categorical
differences
between
working
with
financial
institutions
in
Central
Europe
compared
to
Western
Europe?
Are
attitudes
toward
open
banking
the
same
or
different?
Pulkiewicz:
The
ecosystems
differ,
but
the
main
distinction
we
see
is
not
between
Central
and
Western
Europe,
but
between
individual
countries.
Ireland’s
ecosystem,
for
example,
is
very
open.
It
is
not
only
a
reaction
to
the
British
banking
regulations
that
have
been
the
basis
for
PSD2
and
had
an
effect
on
Ireland,
but
also
the
number
of
fintech
companies
from
the
U.K.
and
Ireland
that
had
quickly
started
working
with
banks
as
they
have
opened.
Poland’s
banks
have
been
working
on
many
innovative
banking
tech
projects,
and
banks
have
implemented
many
solutions
of
their
own,
making
their
ecosystems
quite
closed.
When
you
look
at
Hungary,
it
was
very
fast
with
opening
its
own
data
&#8211;
with
eight
out
of
10
of
the
biggest
banks
in
the
country
providing
their
API
access
in
March
of
2019,
well
before
the
final
implementation
of
PSD2
in
June.
The
central
bank
of
the
country
has
also
created
a
fintech
cooperation
strategy.
The
differences
here
do
not
come
from
geographical
divisions,
but
from
the
local
ecosystems.
Finovate:
In
addition
to
the
platform
enhancements
expected
in
2020,
are
there
any
other
announcements
you
can
preview?
New
partners,
new
investors,
new
markets?
Pulkiewicz:
We
are
definitely
planning
to
expand
to
new
markets
&#8211;
mostly
focusing
on
the
CEE
region.
We
have
a
number
of
really
promising
talks
with
new,
large
partners,
but
we
cannot
really
disclose
any
names
at
this
moment.
When
it
comes
to
investors
&#8211;
we
have
been
very
proud
we
have
managed
to
come
to
this
moment
without
any
external
support,
but
we
are
now
also
looking
for
strategic
partnerships
and
alliances.
