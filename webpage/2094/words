Knightscope
is
a
leader
in
developing
autonomous
security
capabilities
with
a
vision
to
one
day
be
able
to
predict
and
prevent
crime
disrupting
the
$500
billion
security
industry.
The
technology
is
a
profound
combination
of
self-driving
technology,
robotics
and
artificial
intelligence.
William
Santana
Li, 
is
the
Chairman
and
CEO
of 
Knightscope.
He
is
also
a
seasoned
entrepreneur,
intrapreneur
and
former
corporate
executive
at
Ford
Motor
Company.
He
is
also
the
Founder
and
COO
of
GreenLeaf,
which
became
the
world&#8217;s
2nd
largest
automotive
recycler.
Knightscope
was
launched
in
2013
which
was
very
forward
thinking
for
the
time.
What
was
the
inspiration
behind
launching
this
company?
A
professional
and
a
personal
motivation. 
The
professional
answer
is
as
a
former
automotive
executive,
I
believe
deeply
that
autonomous
self-driving
technology
is
going
to
turn
the
world
upside
down
&#8211;
but
just
not
in
agreement
on
how
to
commercialize
the
technology. 
Over
$80
billion
has
been
invested
autonomous
technology
with
something
like
200
companies
on
it
&#8211;
for
years. 
Yet,
no
one
has
shipped
anything
commercially
viable. 
I
believe
Knightscope
is
literally
the
only
company
in
the
world
operating
fully
autonomous
24/7/365
across
an
entire
country,
without
human
intervention,
generating
real
revenue,
with
real
clients,
in
the
real
world. 
Our
crawl,
walk,
run
approach
is
likely
more
suitable
for
this
extremely
complicated
and
execution
intensive
technology. 
My
personal
motivation:
someone
hit
my
town
on
9/11
and
I&#8217;m
still
furious
&#8211;
and
I
am
dedicating
the
rest
of
my
life
to
better
securing
our
country. 
You
can
learn
more
about
why
we
built
Knightscope
here
.
&nbsp;
Knightscope
offers
clients
a
Machine-as-a-Service
(MaaS)
subscription
which
aggregates
data
from
the
robots,
analyzes
it
for
anything
out
of
the
ordinary
and
serves
that
information
to
clients.
What
type
of
data
is
being
collected?
Today
we
can
read
1,200
license
plates
per
minute,
can
detect
a
person,
run
a
thermal
scan,
check
for
rogue
mobile
devices&#8230;.it
is
over
90
terabytes
of
data
a
year
that
no
human
could
ever
process. 
So
our
clients
utilize
our
state-of-the-art
browser-based
user
interface
to
interact
with
the
machines. 
You
can
get
a
glimpse
of
it
here
 &#8211;
we
call
the
KSOC
(Knightscope
Security
Operations
Center).  In
the
future,
our
desire
is
to
have
the
machines
be
able
to
&#8216;see,
feel,
hear
and
smell&#8217;
and
do
100
times
more
than
a
human
could
ever
do
&#8211;
giving
law
enforcement
and
security
professionals
&#8216;superpowers&#8217;
&#8211;
so
they
can
do
their
jobs
much
more
effectively.
&nbsp;
K1
is
a
stationary
machine
which
is
ideal
for
entry
and
exit
points.
What
are
the
capabilities
that
are
offered
with
this
machine?
Yes,
the
K1
operates
primarily
at
ingress/egress
points
for
either
humans
and/or
vehicles. 
All
our
machines
have
the
same
suite
of
technologies
&#8211;
but
at
this
time
the
K1
does
have
facial
recognition
capabilities
which
has
proven
to
be
quite
useful
in
securing
a
location.
The
K3
is
an
indoor
autonomous
robot,
and
the
K5
is
an
outdoor
autonomous
robot,
both
capable
of
autonomous
recharging
and
of
having
conversations
with
humans.
What
else
can
you
tell
us
about
these
robots,
and
is
there
anything
else
that
differentiates
the
two
robots
from
each
other?
The
K3
is
the
smaller
version
capable
of
handling
much
smaller
and
dynamic
indoor
environments.
Obviously
the
K5
is
weatherproof
and
can
even
go
up
ramps
for
vehicles
&#8211;
one
of
our
clients
is
a
9-story
parking
structure
&#8211;
and
the
robot
patrols
autonomously
on
multiple
levels
on
its
own,
which
is
a
bit
of
a
technical
feat.
&nbsp;
Your
robots
have
been
tested
in
multiple
settings
including
shopping
malls
and
parking
lots.
What
are
some
other
settings
or
use
cases
which
are
ideal
for
these
robots?
Basically,
anywhere
outdoors
or
indoors
you
may
see
a
security
guard. 
Commercial
real
estate,
corporate
campuses,
retail,
warehouses,
manufacturing
plants,
healthcare,
stadiums,
airports,
rail
stations,
parks,
data
centers
&#8211;
the
list
is
massive. 
Usually
we
do
well
when
the
client
has
a
genuine
crime
problem
and/or
budget
challenges.
&nbsp;
Could
you
share
with
us
some
of
the
noteworthy
clients
which
are
currently
using
the
robots
in
a
commercial
setting?
Ten
of
the
Fortune
1000
major
corporations
are
clients,
Samsung,
Westfield
Malls,
Sacramento
Kings,
City
of
Hayward,
City
of
Huntington
Park,
Citizens
Bank,
XPO
Logistics,
Faurecia,
Dignity
Health,
Houston
Methodist
Hospital
&#8211;
are
just
a
few
that
come
to
mind. 
 We
operate
across
4
time
zones
in
the
U.S.
only. 
Can
check
them
out
on
our
homepage
at 
www.knightscope.com
&nbsp;
The
K7
is
Multi-Terrain
Autonomous
robot
which
is
currently
under
development.
The
pictures
of
this
robot
look
very
impressive.
What
can
you
tell
us
about
the
future
capabilities
of
the
K7?
The
K7
is
technically
challenging
but
is
intended
to
handle
much
more
difficult
terrain
and
much
larger
environments
&#8211;
with
gravel,
dirt,
sand,
grass,
etc. 
It
is
the
size
of
a
small
car.
&nbsp;
Knightscope
is
currently
fundraising
on
StartEngine.
What
are
the
investment
terms
for
investors?
We
are
celebrating
our
7th
anniversary
and
have
raised
over
$40
million
since
inception
to
build
all
this
technology
from
scratch.
We
design,
engineer,
build,
deploy
and
support
it. 
Made
in
the
USA
&#8211;
and
we
are
backed
by
over
7,000
investors
and
4
major
corporations
and
you
learn
about
our
investor
base 
here
. 
We
are
now
raising
$50
million
in
growth
capital
to
scale
the
Company
up
to
profitability
&#8211;
we
can
accept
accredited
and
unaccredited
investors
as
well
as
domestic
and
international
investors
from
$1,000
to
$10M
completely
online. 
You
can
learn
more
about
the
terms
and
buy
shares
here: 
www.startengine.com/knightscope
&nbsp;
Is
there
anything
else
that
you
would
like
to
share
about
Knightscope?
As
I
write
this
response,
we
are
in
complete
lockdown
in
Silicon
Valley
due
to
the
global
pandemic. 
The
crazy
thing
is
that
our
clients
are
&#8216;essential
services&#8217;
(law
enforcement
agencies,
hospitals,
security
teams)
so
we
must
continue
to
operate
24/7/365. 
You
can
read
more
about
why
I
think
you
should
consider
investing
in
Knightscope 
here
 &#8211;
but
these
days
the
important
thing
to
remember
is
that robots
are
immune!
Thank
you
for
sharing
information
about
your
amazing
startup.
