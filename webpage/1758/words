In
machine
learning
,
most
tasks
can
be
easily
categorized
into
one
of
two
different
classes:
supervised
learning
problems
or
unsupervised
learning
problems.
In
supervised
learning,
data
has
labels
or
classes
appended
to
it,
while
in
the
case
of
unsupervised
learning
the
data
is
unlabeled.
Let’s
take
a
close
look
at
why
this
distinction
is
important
and
look
at
some
of
the
algorithms
associated
with
each
type
of
learning.
Supervised
vs
Unsupervised
Learning
Most
machine
learning
tasks
are
in
the
domain
of
supervised
learning.
In
supervised
learning
algorithms,
the
individual
instances/data
points
in
the
dataset
have
a
class
or
label
assigned
to
them.
This
means
that
the
machine
learning
model
can
learn
to
distinguish
which
features
are
correlated
with
a
given
class
and
that
the
machine
learning
engineer
can
check
the
model’s
performance
by
seeing
how
many
instances
were
properly
classified.
Classification
algorithms
can
be
used
to
discern
many
complex
patterns,
as
long
as
the
data
is
labeled
with
the
proper
classes.
For
instance,
a
machine-learning
algorithm
can
learn
to
distinguish
different
animals
from
each
other
based
off
of
characteristics
like
“whiskers”,
“tail”,
“claws”,
etc.
In
contrast
to
supervised
learning
,
unsupervised
learning
involves
creating
a
model
that
is
able
to
extract
patterns
from
unlabeled
data.
In
other
words,
the
computer
analyzes
the
input
features
and
determines
for
itself
what
the
most
important
features
and
patterns
are.
Unsupervised
learning
tries
to
find
the
inherent
similarities
between
different
instances.
If
a
supervised
learning
algorithm
aims
to
place
data
points
into
known
classes,
unsupervised
learning
algorithms
will
examine
the
features
common
to
the
object
instances
and
place
them
into
groups
based
on
these
features,
essentially
creating
its
own
classes.
Examples
of
supervised
learning
algorithms
are
Linear
Regression
,
Logistic
Regression,
K-nearest
Neighbors
,
Decision
Trees,
and
Support
Vector
Machines
.
Meanwhile,
some
examples
of
unsupervised
learning
algorithms
are
Principal
Component
Analysis
and
K-Means
Clustering.
Supervised
Learning
Algorithm
Linear
Regression
is
an
algorithm
that
takes
two
features
and
plots
out
the
relationship
between
them.
Linear
Regression
is
used
to
predict
numerical
values
in
relation
to
other
numerical
variables.
Linear
Regression
has
the
equation
of
Y
=
a
+bX,
where
b
is
the
line’s
slope
and
a
is
where
y
crosses
the
X-axis.
Logistic
Regression
is
a
binary
classification
algorithm.
The
algorithm
examines
the
relationship
between
numerical
features
and
finds
the
probability
that
the
instance
can
be
classified
into
one
of
two
different
classes.
The
probability
values
are
“squeezed”
towards
either
0
or
1.
In
other
words,
strong
probabilities
will
approach
0.99
while
weak
probabilities
will
approach
0.
K-Nearest
Neighbors
assigns
a
class
to
new
data
points
based
on
the
assigned
classes
of
some
chosen
amount
of
neighbors
in
the
training
set.
The
number
of
neighbors
considered
by
the
algorithm
is
important,
and
too
few
or
too
many
neighbors
can
misclassify
points.
Decision
Trees
are
a
type
of
classification
and
regression
algorithm.
A
decision
tree
operates
by
splitting
up
a
dataset
down
into
smaller
and
smaller
portions
until
the
subsets
can’t
be
split
any
further
and
what
results
is
a
tree
with
nodes
and
leaves.
The
nodes
are
where
decisions
about
data
points
are
made
using
different
filtering
criteria,
while
the
leaves
are
the
instances
that
have
been
assigned
some
label
(a
data
point
that
has
been
classified).
Decision
tree
algorithms
are
capable
of
handling
both
numerical
and
categorical
data.
Splits
are
made
in
the
tree
on
specific
variables/features.
Support
Vector
Machines
are
a
classification
algorithm
that
operates
by
drawing
hyperplanes,
or
lines
of
separation,
between
data
points.
Data
points
are
separated
into
classes
based
upon
which
side
of
the
hyperplane
they
are
on.
Multiple
hyperplanes
can
be
drawn
across
a
plane,
diving
a
dataset
into
multiple
classes.
The
classifier
will
try
to
maximize
the
distance
between
the
diving
hyperplane
and
the
points
on
either
side
of
the
plane,
and
the
greater
the
distance
between
the
line
and
the
points,
the
more
confident
the
classifier
is.
Unsupervised
Learning
Algorithms
Principal
Component
Analysis
is
a
technique
used
for
dimensionality
reduction,
meaning
that
the
dimensionality
or
complexity
of
the
data
is
represented
in
a
simpler
fashion.
The
Principal
Component
Analysis
algorithm
finds
new
dimensions
for
the
data
that
are
orthogonal.
While
the
dimensionality
of
the
data
is
reduced,
the
variance
between
the
data
should
be
preserved
as
much
as
possible.
What
this
means
in
practical
terms
is
that
it
takes
the
features
in
the
dataset
and
distills
them
down
into
fewer
features
that
represent
most
of
the
data.
K-Means
Clustering
is
an
algorithm
that
automatically
groups
data
points
into
clusters
based
on
similar
features.
The
patterns
within
the
dataset
are
analyzed
and
the
datapoints
split
into
groups
based
on
these
patterns.
Essentially,
K-means
creates
its
own
classes
out
of
unlabeled
data.
The
K-Means
algorithm
operates
by
assigning
centers
to
the
clusters,
or
centroids,
and
moving
the
centroids
until
the
optimal
position
for
the
centroids
is
found.
The
optimal
position
will
be
one
where
the
distance
between
the
centroids
to
the
surrounding
data
points
within
the
class
is
minimized.
The
“K”
in
K-means
clustering
refers
to
how
many
centroids
have
been
chosen.
Summary
To
close,
let’s
quickly
go
over
the
key
differences
between
supervised
and
unsupervised
learning.
As
we
previously
discussed,
in
supervised
learning
tasks
the
input
data
is
labeled
and
the
number
of
classes
are
known.
Meanwhile,
input
data
is
unlabeled
and
the
number
of
classes
not
known
in
unsupervised
learning
cases.
Unsupervised
learning
tends
to
be
less
computationally
complex,
whereas
supervised
learning
tends
to
be
more
computationally
complex.
While
supervised
learning
results
tend
to
be
highly
accurate,
unsupervised
learning
results
tend
to
be
less
accurate/moderately
accurate.
