As
business
leaders,
you
understand
the
importance
of
ensuring
your
company’s
message
connects
to
your
audience
with
clarity
and
impact
is
more
critical
now
than
ever.
So,
where
do
you
start?
You
start
with
your
why.
When
you
lead
with
your
why
(written,
in
person,
or
virtually),
you
help
your
audience
understand
your
message
through
your
lens.
Pro-tip:
Stakeholders
are
more
likely
to
embrace
a
message
if
they
know
the
why
behind
it.
So
why
is
this
important?
It
ultimately
helps
avoid
and
mitigate
public
relations
nightmares
and
communications
crisis.
RRight
Now
Communications,
a
boutique
communication
consultancy,
uses
innovative
and
gold
standard
strategies
like
these
to
solve
some
of
the
most
complex
communications
problems
for
our
clients
through
strategic/crisis
communications,
public
speaking
coaching/media
interview
training,
and
media
relations/stakeholder
engagement.
RRight
Now
Communications
can
help
you
connect
to
your
desired
audience,
getting
them
to
listen,
feel,
and
then
act.
As
CEO/chief
strategist,
I
bring
more
than
30
years
of
broadcast
journalism
and
award-winning
marketing/public
relations
experience
to
my
clients.
I
can
train
you
and
your
staff
on
what
makes
a
story,
how
to
tell
a
story,
and
how
to
make
sure
that
story
connects.
How
could
I
not?
I
got
my
training
right
here
in
my
hometown
of
Detroit.
The
IHM
sisters
at
Holy
Redeemer
(now
Cristo
Rey)
Grade/High
School
taught
me
the
importance
of
using
my
voice.
My
first
broadcasting
job
with
radio
legend
Martha
Jean
“The
Queen”
Steinberg
at
WQBH-AM
taught
me
how.
My
Detroit
roots
and
that
foundation
inspired
me
to
help
others
use
their
voice
and
tell
their
story,
whether
in
front
of
a
camera,
online,
or
a
board
room.
Headquartered
in
Cincinnati,
Ohio,
I
work
with
clients
ranging
from
Procter
&amp;
Gamble,
Fifth
Third
Bank,
and
the
third-largest
public
school
system
in
Ohio,
the
Cincinnati
Public
Schools
district.
Currently,
RRight
Now
Communications
is
leading
southwest
Ohio’s
COVID-19
Regional
Communications
strategy
helping
businesses
and
organizations
operate
safely
through
stages
of
the
pandemic.
What’s
your
why
?
Let’s
use
it
to
tell
your
own
story
with
clarity,
authenticity,
and
impact.
