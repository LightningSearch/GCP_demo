Exponential
View
 -Written
by
Azeem
Azhar,
this
is
an
easy
to
digest
weekly
newsletter
which
focuses
on
the
implications
of
new
AI
technology,
such
as
autonomous
vehicles,
data
ownership,
fake
news,
etc.
We
quite
enjoy
how
broad
the
content
is,
it
focuses
on
all
topics
that
matter
to
the
survival
of
the
human
race
and
the
well
being
of
society
in
general.
Import
AI
 &#8211;
This
weekly
newsletter
is
quite
enjoyable
especially
for
people
from
a
non-technical
background.
They
often
profile
real
world
use
cases
for
AI,
as
well
as
discussing
ethical
issues
such
as
machine
learning
bias.
One
thing
that
we
like
is
they
make
sure
to
highlight
why
certain
issues
matter
to
society
in
general.
