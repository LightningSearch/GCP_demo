World’s
Billionaires
List
The
Richest
in
2020
The
richest
people
on
Earth
are
not
immune
to
the
coronavirus.
As
the
pandemic
tightened
its
grip
on
Europe
and
America,
global
equity
markets
imploded,
tanking
many
fortunes.
As
of
March
18,
when
we
finalized
this
list,
Forbes
counted
2,095
billionaires,
58
fewer
than
a
year
ago
and
226
fewer
than
just
12
days
earlier,
when
we
initially
calculated
these
net
worths.
Of
the
billionaires
who
remain,
51%
are
poorer
than
they
were
last
year.
In
raw
terms,
the
world’s
billionaires
are
worth
$8
trillion,
down
$700
billion
from
2019.
Jeff
Bezos
is
the
world’s
wealthiest
person
for
the
third
year
in
a
row,
despite
giving
$36
billion
worth
of
his
Amazon
stock
to
his
ex-wife
MacKenzie
Bezos
as
part
of
their
divorce
settlement
last
summer.
He’s
worth
$113
billion,
buoyed
by
a
15%
rise
in
Amazon’s
shares
since
our
2019
list.
The
e-commerce
giant
he
runs
has
been
in
the
spotlight
amid
the
pandemic;
it’s
hiring
100,000
full-
and
part-time
workers
to
help
meet
increased
demand
from
consumers
staying
home
and
shopping
online.
Bill
Gates
keeps
his
spot
as
number
two
richest,
followed
by
luxury
goods
tycoon
Bernard
Arnault
,
who
nudged
out
Warren
Buffett
to
move
into
the
number
three
spot
for
the
first
time.
Alice
Walton,
an
heir
to
the
Walmart
fortune,
is
the
richest
woman,
ranked
No.9
at
$54.4
billion.
Altogether
241
women
made
the
list,
including
7
who
share
a
fortune
with
a
spouse,
sibling
or
child.
The
biggest
gainer
in
dollar
terms
is
Qin
Yinglin
,
the
world’s
richest
pig
breeder.
He’s
ranked
No.
43
and
is
worth
$18.5
billion--a
$14.2
billion
jump
since
the
2019
list,
after
shares
of
his
Shenzhen-listed
Muyuan
Foods
nearly
tripled
as
the
African
swine
flu
reduced
the
supply
of
pigs
and
drove
up
prices.
Altogether,
267
people
who
made
last
year’s
list
have
dropped
off
as
businesses
faltered;
among
the
most
notable
drop-offs
is
Adam
Neumann
of
WeWork.
Another
21
people
died.
Still,
Forbes
found
178
newcomers
hailing
from
20
countries,
including
some,
like
Zoom
Video
Communications’
founder
and
CEO
Eric
Yuan,
whose
service
is
booming
amid
our
current
shelter-in-place
reality.
The
U.S.
remains
the
country
with
the
most
billionaires,
with
614,
followed
by
greater
China
(including
Hong
Kong
and
Macao),
with
456.

Methodology
The
Forbes
World’s
Billionaires
list
is
a
snapshot
of
wealth
using
stock
prices
and
exchange
rates
from
March
18,
2020.
Some
people
become
richer
or
poorer
within
days
of
publication.
We
list
individuals
rather
than
multigenerational
families
who
share
fortunes,
though
we
include
wealth
belonging
to
a
billionaire’s
spouse
and
children
if
that
person
is
the
founder
of
the
fortune.
In
some
cases
we
list
siblings
or
couples
together
if
the
ownership
breakdown
among
them
isn’t
clear,
but
here
an
estimated
net
worth
of
$1
billion
per
person
is
needed
to
make
the
cut.
We
value
a
variety
of
assets,
including
private
companies,
real
estate,
art
and
more.
We
don’t
pretend
to
know
each
billionaire’s
private
balance
sheet
(though
some
provide
it).
When
documentation
isn’t
supplied
or
available,
we
discount
fortunes.
