They promise daily driving competency as well as weekend adventuring talent. The desire for of-the-moment tech also is strong, with drivers and passengers demanding 24/7 connectivity. That means enough USB ports to charge multiple smartphones or interact with a system (usually on an oversized touchscreen) that requires zero learning curve and some form of voice control. Light trucks—a category that includes pickups, SUVs and minivans—now account for nearly 80% of new car sales in the U.S. Almost 70% of those sales are from SUVs; about 25% fit into the mid- and full-size category, stretching between 190 and more than 200 inches. No matter what the flavor—mainstream, premium, off-road ready—it’s undeniable that Americans prefer larger vehicles. Cheaper gas also makes the case for SUVs even stronger. Today petrol sells for 20 cents a gallon less than the historical inflation-adjusted average of $2.40, according to AAA. Many advances in safety technology and powertrains have made these once cumbersome transporters more livable and fuel-efficient than ever before. Our top picks identify the utility vehicles that go above and beyond, offering buyers that want to haul people and things standout characteristics such as affordable luxury, approachable capability, thoughtful interiors, innovative powertrains and tech—so much tech.

The powertrain lineup still comprises the 355-horsepower 5.3-liter and 420 horsepower 6.2-liter V8 engines and offers a new third option: a 3.0-liter six-cylinder Duramax turbo-diesel that matches the larger V8’s 460 pound-feet of torque and gets 24 mpg in city and highway driving combined. Based on testing, it also should easily top 30 mpg on the highway, well above the EPA’s 26 mpg rating.

Also standard is a new 10.1-inch touchscreen and a half-dozen advanced driver-assistance tech, including automatic emergency braking for cars and pedestrians, stop-and-go adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assistance, automatic high beams and blind spot monitoring.

The GV80’s styling is reminiscent of Bentley, unsurprising as its designer is responsible for fashioning the ultra-high-end Bentayga. It also shares driving characteristics with German rivals thanks to its rear-drive platform (not to mention the head of Genesis R&amp;D is the former chief engineer for BMW’s M performance division). Besides being fun-to-drive, the GV80’s platform accentuates its long hood and cab-rearward design, setting it apart visually from front-drive, car-based SUVs. The GV80 offers two engine choices: a 300-horsepower 2.5-liter four-cylinder and a twin-turbo 3.5-liter V6 that makes 375 horsepower and comes only with an all-wheel drivetrain. The luxurious interior of the GV80 features a high-mounted 14.5-inch touchscreen with navigation that overlays street camera views with directional graphics.

It also offers a segment-leading 18 cubic-feet behind the third row. For 2021, Hyundai added a top-end Calligraphy trim that includes exclusive exterior lighting, 20-inch wheels, a unique grille design and a Nappa leather interior. It also gets all-wheel drive and a pre-set driving mode for the snow, which means it’s proficient in inclement weather, a major plus for parents who live in seasonal regions. What really wows is the long list of standard safety and driver-assistance tech across the line: adaptive cruise control with stop and go capability, lane following, lane keeping assistance, forward collision avoidance assistance with pedestrian detection and driver attention warning.

Its ground clearance is 8 inches, the minimum required for consideration as an authentic trailblazer.

Luckily the new Defender delivered with its modern styling cues and classic off-road dominance.

With seating for up to seven people, it shares its exterior styling with its larger SUV sibling. There are no wrong choices when it comes to Aviator powertrains; both are smooth and compliant. All Aviators use the same powertrain, a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 that delivers 400 horsepower and 415 pound-feet of torque. A plug-in hybrid model, only available with AWD, pairs it with a 13.6 kilowatt-hour battery pack and an electric motor for 494 horsepower and 630 pound-feet of torque. It’s shockingly quick, gets 23 mpg in combined city and highway driving and can travel 21 miles on electricity alone. Standard across the lineup is blind spot monitoring, automatic emergency braking, lane keeping assistance and automatic high-beam headlights.

With seating for up to seven people, it shares its exterior styling with its larger SUV sibling. There are no wrong choices when it comes to Aviator powertrains; both are smooth and compliant. All Aviators use the same powertrain, a twin-turbocharged 3.0-liter V6 that delivers 400 horsepower and 415 pound-feet of torque. A plug-in hybrid model, only available with AWD, pairs it with a 13.6 kilowatt-hour battery pack and an electric motor for 494 horsepower and 630 pound-feet of torque. It’s shockingly quick, gets 23 mpg in combined city and highway driving and can travel 21 miles on electricity alone.

Its muscular lines and athletic presence underlines its inherent capability, and its 8.7-inches of ground clearance is obvious at first glance. The Outback has a 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine that delivers 182 horsepower and 176 pound-feet of torque. Higher trims get a turbocharged 2.4-liter four-cylinder engine with 260 horsepower and 277 pound-feet of torque. All models can tow up to 3,500 pounds when properly equipped. The two-function X-Mode all-wheel-drive system automatically adjusts traction based on the situation (if, say, one wheel lifts off the ground) and gives the Outback a boost on snow, dirt and mud. Inside, two standout features make life easier: a giant 11.6-inch touchscreen and seat release levers that make easy work of folding rear seats (which expands cargo space to 75 cubic feet). The Outback includes a slew of great safety features, from its 360-degree surround-view camera and reverse automatic braking, which will stop the car if it detects an obstacle behind it.

A 295-horsepower V6 engine is standard, but a hybrid version uses a four-cylinder engine and two electric motors to provide better than 35 mpg in city and highway driving. The Highlander offers front-seat passengers an inset shelf in the dash that’s perfect for stashing smartphones, lip balm, loose change or a sandwich (we’re not judging). There’s also ducting from the shelf to the USB jacks at the base of the console that hides the cords. This doesn’t improve zero-to-60 times (7 to 8 seconds), but it makes real people real happy during daily commutes and long trips. A year into its fourth generation, the Highlander is tracking to amass nearly a quarter-million sales in 2020, best of any midsize SUV.
