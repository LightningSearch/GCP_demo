Why
should
you
partner
with
Pulse
2.0?
Every
day,
thousands
of
technology
and
business
professionals
visit
Pulse
2.0
to
read
the
most
pertinent
news
that
affects
their
lives.
Our
audience
includes
technology
leaders,
venture
capitalists,
startup
founders,
entrepreneurs,
and
decision-makers
across
every
major
industry.
Raise
Brand
Awareness.
One
of
our
most
popular
options
for
advertising
is
raising
brand
awareness.
This
comes
in
the
form
of
native
content
and
ad
banners.
Native
content
involves
tapping
into
Pulse
2.0’s
proven
track
record
of
profiling
companies,
reviewing
products,
and
zeroing
in
on
breaking
industry
news.
Or
if
you
have
an
event,
webinar,
or
white
paper
that
you
want
to
promote,
we
can
drive
sign-ups
and
downloads.
All
of
this
is
done
with
a
brand
safety
mindset.
Drive
New
Customers.
The
viability
of
business
models
is
based
on
customer
acquisition
costs
(CAC)
and
the
ability
to
monetize
customers.
Using
social
networks
and
search
engine
advertising
to
acquire
new
customers
can
be
expensive
and
ineffective.
Pulse
2.0’s
partners
have
been
able
to
reduce
their
customer
acquisition
costs
by
working
with
our
engineering
and
editorial
teams
to
set
up
contextual
content
that
lowers
CAC
and
directly
target
new
customers
by
setting
up
sign-up
forms
on
those
pages.
Promote
Job
Opportunities.
Finding
the
right
talent
can
be
an
expensive
or
frustrating
process
for
recruiters.
Pulse
2.0
is
able
to
promote
job
opportunities
on
your
website
on
thousands
of
pages

thousands

every
month
at
a
better
price
than
job
search
engines
while
reaching
more
relevant
candidates
at
the
same
time.
Every
