Over
the
past
five
years,
American’s
thirst
for
larger,
high-riding,
cargo-wielding
vehicles
has
transformed
the
fundamentals
of
the
auto
industry.
Automakers
have
shifted
their
focus
away
from
sedans
and
stuffed
their
lineups
with
small
crossovers
and
SUVs
of
all
shapes
and
sizes
to
tackle
every
consumer
need—both
in
the
mainstream
and
luxury
segments. Crossovers
were
once
somewhat
of
a
dirty
word
among
purists,
representing
the
industry’s
adoption
of
a
quirky
sedan
and
utility
vehicle
mashup
that
teetered
between
a
marketing
gimmick
and
true
necessity.
Now
the
compact
segment,
no
matter
what
acronym
it
takes
on—CUV,
SUV,
SAV—is
the
fastest-growing
category
in
the
industry.
Our
top
picks,
considered
for
their
lengths
of
190
inches
or
less,
offer
consumers
an
array
of
problem-solving
characteristics,
from
unexpectedly
spacious
interiors
to
impressive
ground
clearance
and
off-roading
tech,
all
the
way
to
superior
handling
and
show-stopping
style.

Why
We
Picked
It
Acura’s
sporty
RDX
is
smaller
than
its
three-row
MDX
but
pulls
more
weight
on
the
leaderboard
as
the
brand’s
top-selling
model
and
has
been
a
segment
top
seller
for
five
years
straight.
The
current,
fourth-generation
RDX,
was
redesigned
from
the
ground
up
for
the
2019
model
year
and
sits
on
a
new
platform
that
gives
it
more
premium
proportions
and
athletic
handling.
It’s
now
powered
by
a
turbocharged
2.0-liter
inline-four
cylinder
engine
and
10-speed
automatic
transmission
that
delivers
272
horsepower
and
an
impressive
280
pound-feet
of
torque.
When
equipped
with
Acura’s
Super-Handling
All-Wheel-Drive
system
(SH-AWD),
the
RDX
is
even
more
agile
and
fun
to
drive.
Pros

Cons

Why
We
Picked
It
The
Jeep
Wrangler
compact-nearly-midsize
SUV
has
a
long
legacy
of
capability
and
distinctive
styling
that
screams
off-road
adventure.
Though
the
fourth-generation
Wrangler
is
still
at
home
on
dirt
trails,
it’s
well-mannered
on
the
road,
especially
with
its
available
2.0-liter
inline-four
cylinder
engine
with
eTorque
(mild
hybrid
assist
using
a
48-volt
battery)
and
stop/start
technology
that
upped
its
fuel
economy
game
over
previous
generations.
It’s
also
now
available
with
a
3.0-liter
V6
diesel
engine
and
forthcoming
is
a
plug-in
version
that
won’t
offer
many
all-electric
miles
(25
to
be
exact)
but
will
please
with
instant
low-end
torque
from
dual
electric
motors
(combined
output
is
375
horsepower
and
475
pound-feet
of
torque).
The
Wrangler
comes
in
numerous
trims
to
satisfy
the
needs
of
many,
including
its
Unlimited,
which
offers
four
doors.
Jeep
finally
delivered
on
the
diesel
and
also
maintained
the
rock-crawling
prowess
in
its
electrified
4xe
variant
without
revising
the
core
tenets
that
define
the
Wrangler:
four-wheel
drive,
short-overhangs,
high
ground
clearance
and
a
robust
driveline.
Pros
&
Cons
Unstoppable
off-road
capable
Well-mannered
on
road
Wide
range
of
personalization
Wind
and
tire
noise
at
highway
speeds
Ingress
can

for
shorter
drivers

technology
may

Why
We
Picked
It
The
two-row
Corsair
sits
below
the
Nautilus
and
is
Lincoln’s
smallest
and
least
expensive
crossover.
It
debuted
in
2020,
replacing
the
MKC.
It
shares
the
same
platform
as
the
Ford
Escape
but
separates
itself
with
a
more
premium
styling,
upscale
features
and
a
load
of
standard
safety
tech,
including
blind
spot
monitoring,
rear
cross-traffic
alerts,
automatic
emergency
braking,
lane
keeping
assistance
and
automatic
headlights.
It’s
clear
Lincoln
put
a
lot
of
thought
into
the
Corsair’s
interior
experience:
the
materials
are
plush,
the
lines
are
clean
and
the
layout
is
comfortable
and
inviting.
There
are
two
trims
of
the
Lincoln
Corsair
and
two
engines:
a
250-horsepower
2.0-liter
inline-four
cylinder
and
a
larger
2.3-liter
four-cylinder
with
295
horsepower.
It’s
expected
that
Lincoln
will
add
a
plug-in
hybrid
variant
with
an
estimated
266
horsepower
and
25
miles
of
pure
electric
range
in
the
near
future.

Why
We
Picked
It
It’s
likely
Mazda
took
its
highly
regarded
Mazda3,
lifted
it
by
2.4
inches
and
added
all-wheel
drive
to
the
menu
to
create
the
CX-30
compact
crossover.
The
CX-30
debuted
for
the
2020
model
year
and
slots
in
between
the
CX-3
and
the
CX-5
(it
also
splits
the
price
difference
of
the
two).
Its
sleek
looks
are
inspired
by
the
brand’s
“Kodo”
design
language
and
feel
fitting
enough
for
an
Italian-bred
crossover
despite
its
Japanese
heritage.
Its
interior
is
configured
smartly
for
its
footprint
and
it’s
clear
Mazda
designers
paid
more
attention
to
the
CX-30’s
hip
and
shoulder
room
than
the
older
CX-3,
which
is
burdened
by
a
jellybean
silhouette.
The
CX-30
boasts
confident
handling
with
the
standard
2.5-liter
four-cylinder
under
its
hood,
and
new
for
2021
is
a
turbocharged
version
that
amps
power
to
250
horsepower
from
186.
Pros
&
Cons

It’s
likely
Mazda
took
its
highly
regarded
Mazda3,
lifted
it
by
2.4
inches
and
added
all-wheel
drive
to
the
menu
to
create
the
CX-30
compact
crossover.
The

for
the
2020
model
year
and
slots
in
between
the
CX-3
and
the
CX-5
(it
also
splits
the
price
difference
of
the
two).
Its
sleek
looks
are
inspired
by
the
brand’s
“Kodo”
design
language
and
feel
fitting
enough
for
an
Italian-bred
crossover
despite
its
Japanese
heritage.
Its
interior
is
configured
smartly
for
its
footprint
and
it’s
clear
Mazda
designers
paid
more
attention
to
the
CX-30’s
hip
and
shoulder
room
than
the
older
CX-3,
which
is
burdened
by
a
jellybean
silhouette.
The
CX-30
boasts
confident
handling
with
the
standard
2.5-liter
four-cylinder
under
its
hood,
and
new
for
2021
is
a
turbocharged
version
that
amps
power
to
250
horsepower
from

Why

Picked

The
Mazda
CX-5
small
crossover
is
the
result
of
the
brand’s
effort
to
streamline
both
the
Tribute
and
CX-7
into
a
single
model.
It
also
was
one
of
the
first
vehicles
in
Mazda’s
lineup
to
adopt
the
“Kodo”
design
language
with
a
forward-leaning
nose,
slim
headlamps
and
minimal
body
adornments.
The
CX-5
also
offers
something
its
German
rivals
can’t
match:
a
fully-loaded,
crossover
with
a
turbocharged
engine
for
less

$40,000.

variant
(Skyactive-D)
with

Why
We
Picked
It
The
Nissan
Rogue
compact
crossover
is
an
important
vehicle
to
the
automaker
and
it’s
not
hard
to
see
why:
last
year
it
sold
over
200,000
units
and
it’s
still
nipping
at
the
heels
of
the
Toyota
RAV4
and
Honda
CR-V,
which
currently
are
kings
of
the
mainstream
compact
crossover
court.
The
Rogue,
which
has
always
doubled
proficiently
as
a
dependable
daily
driver
and
weekend
warrior,
underwent
some
major
changes
for
the
2021
model
year
that
make
it
a
good
choice
for
more
than
its
reliability.
A
clean,
modern
design,
a
new
2.5-liter
inline-four
cylinder
engine,
a
refined
ride
quality
(thanks
to
its
significantly
stiffer
structure
and
revised
suspension)
and
an
upgraded
interior
make
this
Rogue
feel
way
more
grown
up.
It’s
also
generously
loaded
with
standard
safety
tech,
including
automatic
emergency
braking
with
pedestrian
and
cyclist
detection,
rear
automatic
braking
and
an
intelligent
driver
alertness
system.
Driver
warnings
for
crossing
outside
of
lane
markers,
objects
in
the

and

Why
We
Picked
It
The
Macan
compact
crossover
is
one
of
the
newest
members
of
the
Porsche
family
and
is
a
sporty
yet
practical
smaller
version
of
its
Cayenne
sibling.
The
best-seller
among
Porsches,
it
received
a
substantial
update
in
2019
and
was
reunited
with
the
Turbo
and
GTS
variants
for
the
2020
model
year.
The
base
Macan
has
a
turbocharged
248-horsepower
2.0-liter
inline-four
cylinder,
and
the
S
adds
an
extra

a
3.0-liter
turbocharged
V6.
The
GTS
has
a
twin-turbo
2.9-liter
V6
that
delivers
375
horsepower
and
the
Turbo
brings
an
impressive
434
horsepower
from
its
twin-turbo
2.9-liter
V6.
Porsche’s
classical
styling
translates
well
on
the
larger
Macan,

the
highlight
is
that
the
crossover
doesn’t
compromise
much
in

handling.

Why
We
Picked
It
The
Volvo
XC40
subcompact
crossover
is
the
smallest
and
newest
member
of
Volvo’s
SUV
lineup
and
also
has
the
most
distinct
styling,
with
a
boxier,
more
youthful
design
than
the
larger
XC60
and
XC90
SUVs.
It
also
is
the
first
Volvo
to
use
the
Compact
Modular
Architecture,
which
was
purposefully
developed
by
the
automaker
for
use
in
global
small
car
production.
The
XC40
is
offered
in
three
trims
(Momentum,
R-Design
and
Inscription)
with
a
turbocharged
2.0-liter
four-cylinder
engine
that
delivers
either
187
or
248
horsepower.
The
punchier
engine
is
only
available
with
an
all-wheel

Another
fun
fact
about
the
XC40
that
further
separates
it
from

that
it

Volvo’s
push

electrification.
An
all-electric
variant,
the
XC40
Recharge,
joined
the

for
2021,
setting
the
precedent
for
electric
expansion
across

The
