to

What
is
Term
Life
Insurance?
Term
life
insurance
is
a
policy
where
you
choose
the
length
of
coverage,
usually
starting
at
five
years.
Other
choices
are
10,
15,
25
and
30
years.
A
few
companies
offer
35-year
term
life
policies,
and
two
companies
offer
40-year
policies:
Banner
Life
and
Protective
Life.
Being
able
to
choose
a
length
is
ideal
if
you
need
life
insurance
to
cover
a
specific
financial
concern,
such
as
income
replacement
during
your
working
years.
This
would
give
your
family
a
replacement
for
your
salary
if
you
pass
away
unexpectedly.
Other
worries
that
can
be
covered
by
term
life
insurance
include:
Covering
the
length
of
mortgage
debt
Covering
the
years
until
your
children
graduate
from
college
If
you
live
past
the
end
of
the
term
life
insurance
policy,
it
expires
and
there’s
no
refund
or
payout.
While
this
may
not
seem
ideal,
it’s
one
of
the
reasons
that
term
life
is
much
less
expensive
than
other
forms
of
life
insurance,
such
as
whole
life
insurance.
Another
reason
that
term
life
is
less
expensive
is
that
it
doesn’t
have
any
cash
value.
You
can’t
take
money
out
of
the
policy
through
a
loan
or
withdrawal.
Advice
for
Finding
the
Best
Term
Life
Insurance
Price
will
naturally
appear
to
be
the
most
compelling
factor
when
buying
term
life
insurance.
But
it’s
important
to
also
look
at
features
and
benefits
a
policy
will
give
you
after
you
buy
it,
especially
as
you
approach
the
end
of
your
initial
rate
guarantee
period.
After
all,
needs
can
change
over
time.
You
might
be
glad
later
that
you
bought
a
policy
that
offers
the
right
to
convert
to
permanent
insurance
or
that
offers
an
early
payout
for
long-term
care
expenses.
Bob
Bland,
CEO
of
Life
Quotes,
says
that
term
life
insurance
looks
and
sounds
simple,
but
don’t
overlook
a
policy’s
features.
His
advice
is:
First,
determine
how
much
life
insurance
you
need
.
Then
choose
an
initial
rate
guarantee
period.
This
is
the
time
during
which
your
premiums
won’t
change.
After
the
rate
guaranteed
period,
you
can
likely
renew,
but
at
a
higher
rate.
Make
sure
you
know
and
understand
the
available
benefits,
riders
and
what
happens
when
the
initial
rate
guarantee
period
ends.
Look
very
closely
at
the
conversion
window
and
any
available
living
benefits,
if
available.
How
Long
Does
It
Take
to
Buy
a
Term
Life
Insurance
Policy?
The
pandemic
has
thrown
some
speed
bumps
into
the
life
insurance
application
process.
An
increase
in
interest
in
life
insurance,
the
lower
availability
of
paramedical
professionals
to
do
exams
and
the
difficulties
of
getting
medical
records
from
doctors’
offices
has
extended
the
underwriting
process
in
many
cases.
Bland
advises
that
you
ask
if
the
insurer
offers
temporary
coverage
during
the
underwriting
process,
which
can
give
you
peace
of
mind
if
there
is
a
delay
in
processing
your
application.
But
be
prepared
to
make
a
premium
deposit
in
order
to
get
immediate,
temporary
coverage.
If
you
are
age
50
or
older,
it
really
helps
to
have
a
history
of
regular
checkups,
says
Bland.
If
a
speedy
decision
is
important
to
you,
make
sure
you
ask
about
the
timeline
to
expect
before
you
apply.
There
are
also
instant-decision

Methodology
We
scored
life
insurance
companies
based
on
their
term
life
rates
and
policy
features
using
data
provided
by
Life
Quotes
,
an
online
brokerage
that
represents
40
life
insurers
and
gives
instant
quotes
online
for
$5,000
to
$25
million.
Life
Quotes
does
not
require
personal
information
in
order
to
get
quotes.
Because
many
term
life
insurance
shoppers
focus
on
price,
we
gave
the
majority
of
weight
to
rates.
Two-thirds
of
total
score:
Term
life
insurance
rates.
We
scored
each
company’s
rates
for
20-year
term
life
insurance
coverage
for
$500,000,
$1
million
and
$2
million,
for
non-smoking
healthy
men
and
women
of
average
height
and
weight,
for
ages
30,
40
and
50.
We
averaged
each
company’s
life
insurance
quotes
across
these
coverage
levels
and
ages
to
determine
each
company’s
price
score.
The
best
term
life
insurance
companies
for
you
will
vary
based
on
your
health
and
other
factors.
One-third
of
total
score:
Policy
features.
The
options
available
within
a
term
life
insurance
policy
can
become
critically
important
years
after
you
buy
the
policy.
Within
this
category
we
gave
equal
scoring
weight
to:
Living
benefits:
This
gives
an
early
payout
option
if
you
become
ill
and
meet
the
eligibility
rules
for
living
benefits.
You
can
access
cash
from
the
policy’s
death
benefit.
The
companies
with
living
benefits
earned
more
points.
Term
life
conversion:
A
conversion
feature
allows
you
to
convert
the
term
life
policy
to
a
permanent
life
insurance
policy
without
health
questions
or
a
medical
exam.
This
feature
becomes
crucial
for
policyholders
who
develop
health
conditions
but
need
longer
coverage.
The
companies
with
older
ages
for
conversion
earned
higher
scores.
Guaranteed
renewability:
Term
life
policies
generally
allow
you
to
renew
the
policy
after
the
level
term
period
ends.
The
new
rate
will
often
be
much
higher
than
the
level
term
rate,
but
allows
you
to
continue
coverage
without
health
questions
or
an
exam.
If
you
become
uninsurable,
this
is
a
way
to
extend
your
coverage.
The
companies
offering
older
ages
for
renewal
earned
more
points.
Ability
to
change
face
amount:
The
companies
we
evaluated
all
allow
a
decrease
in
term
life
face
amounts.
If
your
need
for
coverage
decreases,
this
gives
you
a
good
way
to
lower
your
costs
without
buying
a
new
policy.
The
companies
with
fewer
restrictions
on
when
you
can
make
a
decrease
earned
more
points.

you
need
life
insurance
to
cover
a
specific
time
period
or
need,
such
as
the
years
you’re
paying
a
mortgage,
or
the
years
until
your
children
graduate
from
college.
&nbsp;
Many
people
buy
life
insurance
after
getting
married,
having
a
baby
or
buying
a
house.
Other
types
of
life
insurance
are
available
if
you
need
lifelong
coverage.
Will
taking
a
medical
exam
get
me
better
term
life
insurance
rates?
There
are
increasingly
more
options
available
for
instant
life
insurance
that
is
competitively
priced
with
policies
that
require
a
medical
exam.
The
older
and
less
healthy
you
are,
the
more
likely
you’ll
need
to
take
an
exam
as
part
of
the
application
process
and
to
get
the
best
rates.
&nbsp;
If
you’re
taking
a
life
insurance
medical
exam
,
there
are
ways
to
make
sure
you
get
the
best
results
possible.
This
includes
getting
a
good
sleep
and
avoiding
caffeine
and
rigorous
exercise
before
the
exam.
Is
term
life
insurance
right
if
I
only
want
to
cover
a
funeral?
The
funds
provided
by
term
life
can
be
used
by
the
beneficiary
to
pay
for
a
funeral
and
other
final
expenses.
But
if
you’re
looking
for
only
a
small
policy
that
will
give
coverage
for
your
entire
life,
there
are
burial
insurance
options.

Editor
I’m
the
Insurance
Analyst
for
Forbes
Advisor.
I’ve
been
writing
about
insurance
for
consumers
for
more
than
20
years.
Insurance
intersects
with
many
parts
of
our
lives,
yet
it’s
tough
to
untangle,
and
wrong
choices
can
make
a
financial
mess.
I’m
here
to
help
you
make
sense
of
it.
I’m
especially
interested
in
how
data
is
affecting
the
price
you
pay
for
all
insurance
types.

The
Forbes
Advisor
editorial
team
is
independent
and
objective.
To
help
support
our
reporting
work,
and
to
continue
our
ability
to
provide
this
content
for
free
to
our
readers,
we
receive
compensation
from
the
companies
that
advertise
on
the
Forbes
Advisor
site.
This
compensation
comes
from
two
main
sources.
First
,
we
provide
paid
placements
to
advertisers
to
present
their
offers.
The
compensation
we
receive
for
those
placements
affects
how
and
where
advertisers’
offers
appear
on
the
site.
This
site
does
not
include
all
companies
or
products
available
within
the
market.
Second,
we
also
include
links
to
advertisers’
offers
in
some
of
our
articles;
these
“affiliate
links”
may
generate
income
for
our
site
when
you
click
on
them.
The
compensation
we
receive
from
advertisers
does
not
influence
the
recommendations
or
advice
our
editorial
team
provides
in
our
articles
or
otherwise
impact
any
of
the
editorial
content
on
Forbes
Advisor.
While
we
work
hard
to
provide
accurate
and
up
to
date
information
that
we
think
you
will
find
relevant,
Forbes
Advisor
does
not
and
cannot
guarantee
that
any

provided
is
complete

warranties
in

thereof.
