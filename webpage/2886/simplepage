The pandemic has compelled many people to look at ways to boost the financial security of their families. One way to do that is buying life insurance . Whether you’re shopping for term life insurance for the first time or you’re buying additional life insurance to shore up your financial plan, you’ll want to look beyond the price.

Term life insurance is a policy where you choose the length of coverage, usually starting at five years. Other choices are 10, 15, 25 and 30 years. A few companies offer 35-year term life policies, and two companies offer 40-year policies: Banner Life and Protective Life. Being able to choose a length is ideal if you need life insurance to cover a specific financial concern, such as income replacement during your working years. This would give your family a replacement for your salary if you pass away unexpectedly. Other worries that can be covered by term life insurance include: Covering the length of mortgage debt Covering the years until your children graduate from college If you live past the end of the term life insurance policy, it expires and there’s no refund or payout. While this may not seem ideal, it’s one of the reasons that term life is much less expensive than other forms of life insurance, such as whole life insurance. Another reason that term life is less expensive is that it doesn’t have any cash value. You can’t take money out of the policy through a loan or withdrawal. Advice for Finding the Best Term Life Insurance Price will naturally appear to be the most compelling factor when buying term life insurance. But it’s important to also look at features and benefits a policy will give you after you buy it, especially as you approach the end of your initial rate guarantee period. After all, needs can change over time. You might be glad later that you bought a policy that offers the right to convert to permanent insurance or that offers an early payout for long-term care expenses. Bob Bland, CEO of Life Quotes, says that term life insurance looks and sounds simple, but don’t overlook a policy’s features. His advice is: First, determine how much life insurance you need . Then choose an initial rate guarantee period. This is the time during which your premiums won’t change. After the rate guaranteed period, you can likely renew, but at a higher rate. Make sure you know and understand the available benefits, riders and what happens when the initial rate guarantee period ends. Look very closely at the conversion window and any available living benefits, if available. How Long Does It Take to Buy a Term Life Insurance Policy? The pandemic has thrown some speed bumps into the life insurance application process. An increase in interest in life insurance, the lower availability of paramedical professionals to do exams and the difficulties of getting medical records from doctors’ offices has extended the underwriting process in many cases. Bland advises that you ask if the insurer offers temporary coverage during the underwriting process, which can give you peace of mind if there is a delay in processing your application. But be prepared to make a premium deposit in order to get immediate, temporary coverage. If you are age 50 or older, it really helps to have a history of regular checkups, says Bland. If a speedy decision is important to you, make sure you ask about the timeline to expect before you apply. There are also instant-decision plans available. Here are current average underwriting times.

Average underwriting time in September 2020. <!--ninja_tobody_rendering_done-- > Methodology We scored life insurance companies based on their term life rates and policy features using data provided by Life Quotes , an online brokerage that represents 40 life insurers and gives instant quotes online for $5,000 to $25 million. Life Quotes does not require personal information in order to get quotes. Because many term life insurance shoppers focus on price, we gave the majority of weight to rates. Two-thirds of total score: Term life insurance rates. We scored each company’s rates for 20-year term life insurance coverage for $500,000, $1 million and $2 million, for non-smoking healthy men and women of average height and weight, for ages 30, 40 and 50. We averaged each company’s life insurance quotes across these coverage levels and ages to determine each company’s price score. The best term life insurance companies for you will vary based on your health and other factors. One-third of total score: Policy features. The options available within a term life insurance policy can become critically important years after you buy the policy. Within this category we gave equal scoring weight to: Living benefits: This gives an early payout option if you become ill and meet the eligibility rules for living benefits. You can access cash from the policy’s death benefit. The companies with living benefits earned more points. Term life conversion: A conversion feature allows you to convert the term life policy to a permanent life insurance policy without health questions or a medical exam. This feature becomes crucial for policyholders who develop health conditions but need longer coverage. The companies with older ages for conversion earned higher scores. Guaranteed renewability: Term life policies generally allow you to renew the policy after the level term period ends. The new rate will often be much higher than the level term rate, but allows you to continue coverage without health questions or an exam. If you become uninsurable, this is a way to extend your coverage. The companies offering older ages for renewal earned more points. Ability to change face amount: The companies we evaluated all allow a decrease in term life face amounts. If your need for coverage decreases, this gives you a good way to lower your costs without buying a new policy. The companies with fewer restrictions on when you can make a decrease earned more points. Compare Life Insurance Companies Compare Policies With 8 Leading Insurers Get A Quote Term Life Insurance Policies Used for Scoring The following policies were scored for our ratings: AIG Select-a-Term, American National Signature Term, John Hancock JH Term, Legal &amp; General America OPTerm, Lincoln National LifeElements &amp; TermAccel, Mutual of Omaha Term Life Answers, North American ADDvantage Term, Pacific Life Promise Term, Principal’s Principal Term, Protective Classic Choice Term, Prudential Term Essential &amp; Term Elite, SBLI Level Premium Term, Securian Financial Advantage Elite Term, and Transamerica Trendsetter Super &amp; Trendsetter Living Benefits.

Term life insurance is generally ideal if you need life insurance to cover a specific time period or need, such as the years you’re paying a mortgage, or the years until your children graduate from college. &nbsp; Many people buy life insurance after getting married, having a baby or buying a house. Other types of life insurance are available if you need lifelong coverage. Will taking a medical exam get me better term life insurance rates? There are increasingly more options available for instant life insurance that is competitively priced with policies that require a medical exam. The older and less healthy you are, the more likely you’ll need to take an exam as part of the application process and to get the best rates. &nbsp; If you’re taking a life insurance medical exam , there are ways to make sure you get the best results possible. This includes getting a good sleep and avoiding caffeine and rigorous exercise before the exam. Is term life insurance right if I only want to cover a funeral? The funds provided by term life can be used by the beneficiary to pay for a funeral and other final expenses. But if you’re looking for only a small policy that will give coverage for your entire life, there are burial insurance options.
