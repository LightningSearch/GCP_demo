Customer Experience – February 25 (Check!) Our first FinovateFocus will center around User Experience in banking and finance. A strong user experience starts with the very first marketing message, continues through the account opening process, and culminates in the ongoing service a customer receives. With so many different channels to keep track of (online, mobile, call-center, chatbot, in-branch, and more), it’s no wonder it’s so challenging to ensure a seamless delivery. Payments, Remittance, and Forex – March 31 Payments, Remittance, and Forex – March 31 Moving money quickly and seamlessly is vital for anyone operating in the finance or banking arenas. This month’s Focus will center on technologies that help move money from one place to another. Whether it’s P2P, B2B, transfer, remittance, foreign transactions, few areas of the banking ecosystem have been touched as much by fintech as money-movement. Explore what’s out there now and talk about what’s coming next this March. Learn more Data Technology – April 22 Data Technology – April 22 Big Data has been a hot topic in fintech for a little while, but the importance of having clean, actionable data is growing every day. Not only do financial institutions need to be able to see and store the data that they have, they also need to be able to feed clean data into other applications in order to take advantage of the new possibilities brought about by advancements in artificial intelligence and machine-learning technologies. Are you getting the most out of your organization’s data? Learn more Fraud and Security – May 27 Fraud and Security – May 27 As more financial business has moved to digital channels, preventing fraud and maintaining strict security are more important than ever. In May, we’ll approach the topic from all sides, including KYC, web and mobile security, data breach prevention, breach-response, and more with an eye on mitigating your customers’ risk, and minimize your organizational risk as well. Half-Year Review – June 24 Half-Year Review – June 24 A lot has already happened so far in 2021, and things are still ramping up. At our half-year review, we’ll take a look back at the important developments of the year so far, as well as recap some of the highlights from the previous months’ Focus events. Back-End and Core Technologies – July 29 Back-End and Core Technologies – July 29 Core technologies are vital not only for day-to-day banking operations, but also for the ability to adopt and implement new technologies. Join us in July to learn more about what core-service-providers are doing to update their technologies, and make a plan for future-proofing your own organization by engaging the right back-end technologies. Inclusion and Democratization – August 26 Inclusion and Democratization – August 26 Customer-acquisition is vital for the long-term health of any FI, but there are millions of people all over the world that aren’t able to engage with even the most basic financial tools. This lost opportunity hurts the individuals who are left out, and it also hurts the financial institutions who aren’t able to bring new customers in the door. Learn more about technologies that can help address these fundamental problems at our August Focus event. Technologies to Grow Your Pipeline – September 30 Technologies to Grow Your Pipeline – September 30 Maximizing sales, marketing, and business development is an ever-present concern for any type of organization, but the pressure is particularly acute in financial services. Fintech solutions can help all sides of the process, delivering results that can make a big impact on the bottom line. Lending – October 28 Lending – October 28 Consumer and small-business lending is the backbone of any economy, and it’s a vital source of revenue for banks and credit unions of all sizes. It’s a difficult balancing act, though, as banks need to weigh new opportunities for revenue against minimizing their exposure to risk. Walking that tightrope is difficult, but fintech is here to help, and we’ll spend October’s Focus exploring the best path forward. Digital Transformation – November 18 Digital Transformation – November 18 Updating and upgrading technology stacks is no small feat in the world of finance, but the need for banks to future-proof their digital offerings is very real. In November, we’ll talk through the technologies and best-practices for FIs of all shapes and sizes to help tackle this problem and find a clear path forward in an increasingly digital environment. Full-Year Review – December 16 Full-Year Review – December 16 Just like in June, our full-year review will focus on recapping the important takeaways, new technologies, and evolving ideas coming out of 2021.
