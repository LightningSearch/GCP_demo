Note:
Forbes
may
earn
a
commission
on
sales
made
from
partner
links
on
this
page,
but
that
doesn't
affect
our
editors'
opinions
or
evaluations.
No
single
credit
card
is
the
best
option
for
every
family,
every
purchase
or
every
budget.
Your
credit
history,
the
composition
of
your
family,
how
much
you
spend
and
on
what,
your
travel
plans
and
goals
and
whether
you
are
comfortable
having
multiple
cards
could
all
affect
the
best
card
for
you.
In
short,
the
best
credit
card
for
an
affluent
single
who
splurges
on
foreign
travel
and
eating
out
may
be
different
than
the
best
for
a
cost-conscious
family
that
goes
camping
for
vacation
and
mostly
shops
at
Target.
For
this
reason,
Forbes
Advisor
has
chosen
the
best
credit
cards
in
a
way
designed
to
be
the
most
helpful
to
the
widest
variety
of
readers.
Rather
than
simply
selecting
the
“best
credit
card”
and
ranking
the
next
nine
options,’
we’ve
attempted
to
highlight
the
best
cards
for
a
variety
of
situations.
This
list
contains
only
personal
credit
cards.
If
you’re
looking
for
a
credit
card
for
your
business,

Why
We
Picked
It
While

is
outstanding.

a
regular

a

Methodology
In
order
to
determine
the
best
credit
cards
for
each
category,
we
considered
the
costs
and
benefits
of
each
credit
card.
Costs
of
each
credit
card
include:
the
annual
fee,
foreign
transaction
fee
and
the
required
spending
to
qualify
for
the
welcome
offer.
Benefits
include
the
welcome
offer,
cash
rewards
or
other
rewards,
bonus
category
offers,
balance
transfer
offers,
status
benefits
and
other
perks.
In
addition,
each
category
of
credit
card
has
its
own
criteria.
For
travel
rewards
cards
we
also
considered
how
much
value
you
can
expect
to
get
out
of
your
points
and
miles
when
you
redeem
them.
For
cards
meant
for
those
who
are
trying
to
build
credit
or
improve
their
credit
score,
we
focused
on
credit
card
offers
that
offer
the
most
opportunities
to
improve
your
credit
for
the
lowest
net
cost.
For
balance
transfer
cards
we
looked
at
the
length
of
0%
APR
and
the
variable
APR
after
the
bonus
period
ended.

Citi&reg;
Double
Cash
Card
[
jump
to
details
]
If
you
want
a
simple
cash
back
card,
the
Citi®
Double
Cash
Card
is
a
great
choice.
You’ll
earn
a
flat
rate
of
cash
back
on
each
purchase
with
no
limits
or
categories
to
keep
track
of.
With
this
card
it’s
also
possible
to
convert
your
rewards
to
ThankYou
points,
which
can
be
transferred
to
airline
miles
if
you
also
hold
a
Citi
Premier®
Card
or
Citi
Prestige®
Card
*
.
Rewards:
Earn
2%
cash
back
on
all
purchases—1%
when
you
make
the
purchase
and
1%
when
you
pay
your
credit
card
bill.
Welcome
Offer:
None
Annual
Fee:
$0
Other
Benefits
and
Drawbacks:
The
more
you
use
the
Double
Cash,
the
more
you
earn.
There
are
no
limits,
caps
or
restrictions
on
how
much
cash
back
you
can
earn.
As
long
as
you
pay
your
card
off
every
month
and
avoid
fee-bearing
activities
like
cash
advances
and
balance
transfers,
you
can
use
the
Citi
Double
Cash
card
for
your
daily
purchases
and
earn
a
generous
amount
of
cash
back
without
paying
any
fees
or
interest.
This
Citi
Double
Cash
gives
new
cardholders
an
introductory
APR
of
0%
intro
for
18
months
on
Balance
Transfers
completed
within
the
first
four
months
of
opening
a
new
account,
and
a
variable
APR
after,
based
on
your
creditworthiness
(currently
13.99%
-
23.99%
(Variable)).
Balance
transfers
are
subject
to
a
fee
of
$5
or
3%
of
the
amount
of
each
transfer,
whichever
is
greater.
The
Citi
Double
Cash
does
charge
a
foreign
transaction
fee
so
it’s
not
a
great
choice
for
international
travel.

Double
Cash

Chase
Sapphire
Preferred®
Card
[
jump
to
details
]
If
you’re
wanting
to
get
into
the
Chase
ecosystem
but
the
annual
fee
of
the
Chase
Sapphire
Reserve®
scares
you
away,
the
Chase
Sapphire
Preferred
may
be
a
good
place
to
start.
Rewards:
Earn
2
Ultimate
Rewards
points
per
dollar
spent
on
travel
and
dining
at
restaurants
worldwide,
eligible
delivery
services,
takeout
and
dining
out
and
1
point
per
dollar
spent
on
all
other
purchases.
Welcome
Offer:
Earn
80,000
bonus
points
after
you
spend
$4,000
on
purchases
in
the
first
3
months
from
account
opening.
That's
$1,000
when
you
redeem
through
Chase
Ultimate
Rewards®.
Plus
earn
a
$50
statement
credit
towards
grocery
store
purchases
within
your
first
year
of
account
opening.
Annual
Fee:
$95
Other
Benefits
and
Drawbacks:
Ultimate
Rewards
are
both
flexible
and
valuable,
which
is
why
the
Sapphire
Preferred
Card
makes
our
list
if
you
can’t
justify
the
Sapphire
Reserve’s
higher
annual
fee.
You
have
the
ability
to
transfer
Ultimate
Rewards
to
a
variety
of
airline
frequent
flyer
programs
and
hotel
chains,
such
United
Airlines
and
Hyatt.
An
Ultimate
Rewards
point
from
your
Chase
Sapphire
Preferred®
Card
is
worth
1.25
cents
per
point
when
redeemed
through
the
Chase
travel
portal
or
when
using
Pay
Yourself
Back,
but
if
you
are
going
to
use
the
travel
portal
we
would
recommend
considering
the
higher
annual
fee
Chase
Sapphire
Reserve®
instead
because
your
points
will
be
worth
1.5
cents
each
in
the
same
instances
(in
addition
to
the
ability
to
earn
more
points
on
travel
and
dining
purchases).
The
Chase
Sapphire
Preferred
also
offers
best-in-class
travel
protections,
though
they’re
not
quite
as
good
as
the
Sapphire
Reserve’s
coverage.
The
Chase
Ultimate
Reward
cards
are
best
taken
as
a
family:
partnering
a
Chase
Sapphire
Preferred
with
a
Chase
Freedom®
Flex
card
and
a
Chase
Ink
business
card
allows
you
to
earn
Ultimate
Rewards
quickly.
Rewards
can
also
be
combined
between
family
members
to
really
speed
up
the
pace.

Chase
Freedom
Flex&#8480;
[
jump
to
details
]
The
Chase
Freedom
Flex℠,
launched
in
late
2020,
is
a
newcomer
to
the
field—and
it
launched
with
a
splash.
When
paired
with
a
premium
Chase
Ultimate
Rewards-earning
card
like
the
Chase
Sapphire
Preferred®
Card,
Chase
Sapphire
Reserve®
or
Chase
Ink
Business
Preferred®
Credit
Card,
it
can
earn
powerful
Chase
Ultimate
Rewards
points.
Even
as
a
standalone
cash
back
card,
it’s
tough
to
beat.
Rewards:
Earn
5%
cash
back
on
up
to
$1,500
in
rotating
categories
each
quarter
that
you
activate,
5%
cash
back
on
travel
booked
through
Chase
Ultimate
Rewards,
3%
cash
back
at
restaurants
and
drugstores
and
1%
cash
back
on
all
other
purchases.
Welcome
Offer:
Earn
a
$200
Bonus
after
you
spend
$500
on
purchases
in
your
first
3
months
from
account
opening.
Annual
Fee:
$0
Other
Benefits
and
Drawbacks:
The
Chase
Freedom
Flex
packs
a
huge
punch
for
a
card
without
an
annual
fee.
The
biggest
downside
to
this
card?
You’ll
have
to
remember
to
activate
the
quarterly
bonus
categories
and
track
how
much
you’ve
spent
because
the
rotating
categories
have
a
$1,500
cap—at
least
if
you’re
planning
to
optimize
your
spending.
The
Freedom
Flex
offers
a
three
month
complimentary
membership
to
Door
Dash’s
DashPass—offering
free
delivery
on
orders
over
$12
and
50%
off
DashPass
for
the
following
nine
months.
You’ll
also
get
5%
cash
back
on
Lyft
rides
through
March
2022.
Finally,
you
can
benefit
from
complimentary
cell
phone
insurance
protection
when
you
pay
your
monthly
cell
phone
bill
with
your
card.
Claims
are
limited
to
$800
per
claim
and
$1,000
per
year
total.
This
card
does
charge
a
3%
foreign
transaction
fee
so
it
is
not
a
good
choice
if
you
plan
to
travel
abroad.

Many
trips
have

tied
to
specific
dates
such
as
hotel
or
prepaid
tour
reservations.
If
you
are
interrupted
or

you
could

a
tremendous
amount
of
money.
In
addition
to
offering
the

the
Chase

lost

more.

Annual
Fee:
$550
Other

and

include

that

which
the
American

versions
of

at
over
1,200

worldwide
as

Other
Benefits
and
Drawbacks:
The
biggest
benefit
and
drawback
to
this
card
is
that
you
need
to
make
30
purchases
per
month
to
truly
unlock
the
value
of
the
card.
If
you
do,
this
card
is
a
great
option.
However,
30
purchases
on
this
card
may
not
make
sense
for
everyone.
This
card
also
offers
secondary
rental
car
insurance
coverage
and
return
protection,
but
it
does
charge
foreign
transaction
fees
so
it
is
not
a
good
choice
for
international
travel.

Capital
One
Venture
miles
are
easy
to
redeem
to
“erase”
travel
purchases
from
your
credit
card
statement.
They
are
worth
one
cent
each
when
used
this
way,
which
effectively
means
you’re
earning
2%
cash
back
on
your
purchases.
Capital
One
miles
can
also
be
transferred
to
a
number
of
travel
partners,
but
the
transfer
rate
varies
by
partner
which
can
make
calculating
value
difficult.
The
best
rate
available
for
many
partners
is
2:1.5.
If
you’re
trading
in
2
Venture
miles
for
1.5
airline
miles,
that
means
you’re
effectively
earning
1.5
airline
miles
on
your
purchases,
which
is
not
a
bad
earnings
rate,
depending
on
how
you
use
those
miles.
Before
you
redeem
Venture
miles,
it’s
always
best
to
compare
cash
prices
to
the
number
of
miles
you
would
need
if
you
transfer
to
a
partner
and
see
which
redemption
requires
the
fewest
miles.

How
to
Pick
the
Best
Credit
Card
for
You
With
so
many
choices,
finding
the
best
credit
card
or
cards
can
be
overwhelming.
Before
applying,
consider
the
data
and
do
your
research.
Here
are
some
questions
to
ask:
Are
you
loyal
to
a
specific
store,
airline
or
hotel
chain?
If
so,
a
co-branded
card
might
make
sense
for
you
for
the
perks,
even
if
it
doesn’t
have
the
strongest
earnings
rate.
Will
you
carry
a
balance?
If
so,
you
will
want
to
lean
towards
a
credit
card
that
offers
an
extended
0%
APR
or
balance
transfer
offer.
The
interest
cost
you
save
will
easily
outweigh
the
value
of
any
travel
rewards
or
cash
back
you
might
earn.
Will
your
rewards
offset
the
fees?
Annual
fees
eat
into
your
rewards.
Think
about
your
annual
spending
to
make
sure
you
will
earn
enough
bonus
points
or
cash
back
to
offset
the
fee.
Will
you
use
the
credit
card’s
benefits?
Some
cards
come
with
benefits
such
as
an
annual
travel
statement
credit,
free
checked
bag
or
airport
lounge
membership.
Before
applying
for
a
new
card,
think
about
your
actual
usage
patterns.
Does
this
benefit
actually
have
value
to
you?
If
you
won’t
use
it,
it
shouldn’t
weigh
into
your
decision
about
whether
to
get
the
card.
How
easy
are
the
rewards
to
spend?
Some
cards
have
strong
welcome
bonuses
or
earnings
rates,
but
when
it
comes
to
redeeming
the
rewards,
they
fall
flat.
If
you
don’t
have
the
time
to
research
individual
programs
or
to
wait
for
a
specific
redemption
date
or
amount,
you
might
prefer
a
cash
back
rewards
card
or
flexible
rewards
card.
Are
you
open
to
having
more
than
one
credit
card?
The
best
earnings
strategy
for
most
people
will
involve
having
two
or
more
cards.
One
that
focuses
on
the
bonus
categories
where
you
spend
the
most
and/or
the
perks
offered
by
the
card,
and
a
second
all-around
credit
card
that
offers
a
higher
flat
rate
of
earnings
on
the
rest
of
your
spending.

Frequently
Asked
Questions
What
is
the
best
credit
card
overall?
The
best
overall
credit
card
depends
on
what
your
goals
are
and
how
you
spend
money,
so
the
best
card
isn’t
likely
to
be
the
same
from
person
to
person.
What
credit
score
do
you
need
to
get
a
top
credit
card?
Plan
to
have
a
good
to
excellent
credit
score
to
get
approved
for
most
of
the
top
credit
cards
on
the
market.
Although
there
are
no
hard
rules
on
which
score
qualifies
and
disqualifies
an
applicant,
a
safe
rule
of
thumb
is
to
have
a
score
above
700.
This
is
considered
a
good
credit
score
according
to
Experian,
a
consumer
credit
reporting
company.
Top
credit
cards,
such
as
the
Chase
Sapphire
Reserve
card,
or
the
Citi
Double
Cash
card,
generally
require
users
to
have
good
to
excellent
credit.
Card
holders
with
scores
below
700
should
make
sure
to
pay
off
their
balance
on
time
monthly,
keep
credit
utilization
low
and
maintain
a
history
of
responsible
credit
use
in
order
to
raise
that
score
as
soon
as
possible.
How
many
credit
cards
should
you
have?
First
and
foremost,
make
sure
you
are
already
responsibly
paying
the
balance
on
your
first
credit
card
before
moving
on
to
expanding
to
more
cards.
More
cards
will
add
more
complexity
to
your
financial
life,
so
it’s
good
to
increase
your
responsibility
slowly.
Keep
in
mind
that
applying
for
a
new
credit
card
will
temporarily
drop
your
credit
score,
so
applying
to
multiple
cards
at
the
same
time
is
generally
not
a
smart
move.
If
you
are
already
a
responsible
credit
card
user,
adding
a
second
or
third
credit
card
to
take
advantage
of
multiple
rewards
is
definitely
the
next
step
in
your
personal
finance
journey.
There
is
no
exact
maximum
number
of
credit
cards
you
should
have,
as
everyone’s
spending
habits
and
needs
are
different.
Someone
with
a
10-year
history
building
credit
will
likely
have
more
credit
cards
than
someone
just
starting
to
build
credit.
A
smart
move
is
to 
pick
cards
from
different
popular
networks
,
such
as
Mastercard
or
Visa.
This
is
optional,
but
it’s
smart
to
have
both
a
Mastercard
and
a
Visa
in
your
arsenal.
Some
locations
around
the
world
accept
Visas
much
more
frequently
than
Mastercards,
while
networks
such
as
Discover
are
much
less
accepted.
How
do
you
pick
the
best
credit
card
for
your
specific
needs?
The
most
simple
way
is
to
create
your
personalized
budget
so
you
can
see
exactly
what
are
your
spending
habits.
There
are 
several
apps
 that
can
streamline
this
process
for
you.
Knowing
the
above
data,
you
can
select
the
card
which
best
aligns
with
your
spending
habits.
Spend
a
lot
on
groceries?
Look
for
cards
with
excellent
rewards
on
grocery
purchases.
Spend
a
lot
at
the
pump?
Look
for
cards
with
top
notch
rewards
on
gas.
Next,
calculate
your
rewards
potential,
so
you’ll
know
exactly
how
beneficial
that
card
will
be
for
you.
Keep
tabs
on 
some
additional
card
benefits
,
such
as
warranties,
trip
cancellation
insurance
and
even
price
protection.
What’s
the
best
first
credit
card
to
get?
The 
best
first
credit
card
 to
get
will
be
the
one
to
start
building
your
credit
history.
Don’t
focus
on
travel
rewards
or
cash
back
rates,
these
will
come
later.
Instead,
pick
a
starter
card,
and
responsibly
handle
the
card
until
your
credit
score
improves
to
move
on
to
a
better
credit
card.
What
are
the
types
of
credit
cards
available?
There
are
the
many
different
types
of
credit
cards
available
on
the
market
to
choose
from.
Secured
credit
cards
:
A
secured
credit
card
is
intended
for
a
user
with
bad
credit
or
a
short
credit
history.
Users
deposit
cash
in
return
for
credit
limit.
After
some
months,
if
used
responsibly,
users
can
then
switch
to
an
unsecured
credit
card,
which
does
not
require
an
upfront
deposit.
Student
credit
cards
:
Student
credit
cards
are
intended
for
users
just
starting
to
build
credit.
The
card
generally
has
an
educational
reward,
such
as
a
statement
credit
if
the
student
maintains
or
exceeds
a
certain
GPA.
Business
credit
cards
:
Business
credit
cards
are
split
into
small
business
and
corporate
credit
cards.
Large
business
with
an
established
credit
history
will
opt
for
a
corporate
credit
card,
while
newer
businesses
with
a
short
credit
history
will
use
the
small
business
credit
card.
Cash
back
credit
cards
:
Cash
back
credit
cards
give
users
cash
rewards
after
certain
purchases,
typically
within
a
one
to
five
percent
range,
depending
on
the
card.
These
cards
also
reward
purchases
in
certain
categories
differently,
such
as
restaurants,
groceries,
gas,
etc.
Users
should
match
these
cards’
rewards
to
align
with
their
spending
habits.
Travel
rewards
credit
cards
:
Travel
reward
credit
cards
are
great
options
for
users
looking
to
save
on
airline
purchases
and
hotel
stays.
Users
earn
mileage
after
purchases,
which
can
add
up
to
significant
savings
on
travel
related
purchases.
As
always,
compare
the
different
travel
reward
cards
to
see
which
option
best
suits
your
goals.
Brand
credit
cards:
Store
cards
such
as
Target’s
RedCard
or
Amazon
Prime
Rewards
Visa
Signature
 may
provide
some
benefits
for
these
brand
enthusiasts.
Still,
make
sure
to
calculate
your
own
personal
rewards
potential
to
see
if
having
these
cards
is
truly
worth
it,
as
most
users
will
find
these
cards
generally
do
not
provide
as
much
upside
compared
to
other
types
of
credit
cards.
0%
intro
APR
 and 
balance
transfer
credit
cards
:
Some
cards
offer
a
0%
introductory
APR,
meaning
consumers
pay
no
interest
on
their
balance
during
the
introductory
period.
Once
this
intro
period
expires,
the
APR
will
go
back
to
the
original
rate
listed
in
the
fine
print.
Keep
in
mind,
users
might
still
have
to
pay
a
balance
transfer
fee,
which
is
typically
in
the
range
of
three
percent
to
five
percent
of
the
amount
transferred.
