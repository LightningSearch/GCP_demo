Vijay
Kurkal
serves
as
the
CEO
for
Resolve
where
he
oversees
the
strategic
growth
of
the
company
as
it
helps
maximize
the
potential
of
AIOps
and
IT
automation
in
enterprises
around
the
world.
Vijay
has
a
long
history
in
the
tech
industry,
having
spent
the
last
twenty
years
working
with
numerous
software
and
hardware
companies
that
have
run
the
gamut
from
mainframe
to
bleeding-edge,
emerging
tech.
Before
joining
Resolve,
he
held
leadership
positions
at
IBM,
VMware,
Bain
&amp;
Company,
and
Insight
Partners,
playing
a
critical
role
in
accelerating
the
growth
of
a
wide
array
of
technology
companies
and
introducing
state-of-the-art
product
lines.
You’ve
been
leading
Resolve
since
2018,
first
as
COO,
and
now
as
CEO.
What
initially
drew
you
to
this
company?
There’s
a
huge
need
for
automation
and
AIOps
today
given
the
challenges
that
enterprise
IT
organizations
face.
These
teams
are
managing
increasingly
complex,
highly
virtualized,
hybrid
environments
and
are
tasked
with
rapidly
implementing
new
technologies
to
stay
competitive.
Without
the
aid
of
tools
like
automation
and
AIOps,
it’s
impossible
to
effectively
manage
these
environments,
and
the
complexity
is
only
going
to
grow.
Given
the
tremendous
market
opportunity,
I
was
immediately
drawn
to
Resolve’s
deep
roots
in
automation.
Drawing
on
my
20
years
of
experience
with
a
wide
range
of
tech
companies,
I
am
incredibly
excited
about
the
possibility
for
automation
and
AIOps
to
truly
transform
IT
operations.
These
technologies
are
game
changers
for
companies
—
not
just
to
survive,
but
to
thrive
in
the
current
environment.
As
we’ve
seen
over
the
last
few
months
as
digital
transformation
has
rapidly
accelerated,
automation
is
absolutely
necessary
to
succeed.
Resolve
is
uniquely
positioned
to
meet
these
needs
and
usher
in
the
next
generation
of
IT
operations.
&nbsp;
How
would
you
best
describe
what
Resolve
offers
IT
companies?
By
combining
cutting-edge
AIOps
capabilities
with
our
industry-leading
automation
platform
,
Resolve
helps
IT
teams
achieve
more
agile,
autonomous
IT
operations
even
as
infrastructure
continues
to
expand
in
scope
and
complexity.
Our
unified
product
offers
a
closed
loop
of
discovery,
analysis,
detection,
prediction,
and
automation,
including
prebuilt
automations
that
can
be
autonomously
triggered
by
AIOps
insights
to
stay
ahead
of
problems
and
lighten
the
load
on
IT
organizations.
Our
goal
is
to
help
ITOps,
NetOps,
and
Service
Desk
teams
meet
the
growing
demands
on
IT,
streamline
operations,
reduce
costs,
improve
MTTR
and
performance,
and
accelerate
service
delivery
through
the
power
of
automation
and
AIOps.
&nbsp;
For
readers
who
are
not
familiar
with
the
term
AIOps,
can
you
explain
what
this
term
describes
and
what
makes
it
so
important?
AIOps
–
or
AI
for
IT
Operations
–
helps
streamline
the
management
of
complex,
hybrid
IT
environments
by
deploying
AI,
machine
learning
and
advanced
analytics
to
aggregate,
analyze,
and
contextualize
tremendous
amounts
of
data
amassed
from
various
sources
across
the
IT
ecosystem.
These
insights
facilitate
the
identification
of
existing
or
potential
performance
issues
while
spotting
anomalies
and
pinpointing
the
probable
root
cause
of
incidents.
Over
time,
machine
learning
can
predict
future
issues
and
proactively
automate
fixes
before
they
affect
the
business.
Additionally,
most
AIOps
tools
offer
advanced
correlation
capabilities
help
IT
pros
determine
how
alarms
are
related,
reducing
noise
by
grouping
similar
events
and
bringing
the
true
issues
to
light,
so
people
can
focus
on
what
matters
most.
Some
AIOps
solutions
also
perform
auto-discovery
and
dependency
mapping
to
provide
deep
visibility
into
how
entities
are
connected
to
one
another,
and
how
outages
might
impact
critical
business
services.
This
offers
a
wide
range
of
benefits
from
keeping
your
CMDB
up-to-data
and
accurate,
to
accelerating
incident
response
and
simplifying
troubleshooting,
change
management,
and
compliance.
&nbsp;
What
are
some
of
the
data
challenges
faced
by
IT
companies?
By
far
the
biggest
data
challenge
IT
organizations
face
is
managing
increased
complexity
caused
by
exponential
infrastructure
growth
and
the
daily
onslaught
of
new
technologies.
Data
volumes
and
alarm
noise
created
by
infrastructure
growth
have
far
exceeded
human
capacity
to
find
the
needle
in
the
proverbial
IT
haystack.
Gartner
estimates
a
two-
to
three-fold
increase
in
data
volume
growth
per
year.
To
survive
in
this
dynamic
environment,
it’s
critical
for
IT
organizations
to
embrace
AIOps
and
automation
to
help
them
cope
with
massive
amounts
of
data
and
to
streamline
management
of
new
technologies.
&nbsp;
How
can
businesses
overcome
these
challenges
using
Resolve?
Resolve
enables
businesses
to
manage
increasing
IT
complexity
with
fewer
resources
through
the
powerful
combination
of
AIOps
and
automation.
The
platform
is
designed
to
provide
immediate
relief,
as
well
as
long-term
value.
Unlike
many
other
AIOps
solutions
on
the
market,
customers
don&#8217;t
have
to
wait
months
to
start
seeing
value
with
Resolve.
In
fact,
customers
get
value
in
literally
minutes
with
Resolve&#8217;s
automated
discovery
and
dependency
mapping.
These
capabilities
enable
us
to
generate
complete
infrastructure
visualizations,
detailed
cross-domain
topology
maps,
application
dependency
maps,
and
comprehensive
views
of
inventory.
Additionally,
Resolve
ingests
data
from
many
other
tools
(such
as
monitoring,
event
management,
ITSM,
and
logging
solutions)
and
aggregates
it
with
telemetry
data
collected
natively
by
our
own
platform.
This
allows
customers
to
achieve
the
much-sought-after
&#8216;single
pane
of
glass&#8217;
that
they
need
to
effectively
manage
complex,
hybrid
infrastructure,
and
it
provides
significantly
richer
(and
complete)
visibility
across
domains.
Over
the
course
of
several
weeks,
these
insights
are
enhanced
and
enriched
as
Resolve
&#8220;learns&#8221;
the
environment
and
leverages
machine
learning
to
perform
activities
like
event
correlation
and
clustering,
predictive
analytics,
multivariate
anomaly
detection,
dynamic
thresholding,
and
autonomous
remediation
–
making
the
product
exponentially
more
intelligent
(and
valuable)
over
time.
Our
enterprise-class
automation
capabilities
can
take
action
on
insights
from
the
AIOps
components
or
can
be
used
independently.
Built
for
the
scale
and
complexity
of
modern,
hybrid
environments,
the
platform
can
handle
everything
from
simple
tasks
to
very
complex
processes
that
go
well
beyond
the
capacity
of
other
tools.
Combining
AIOps
with
this
level
of
automation
offers
an
unparalleled
ability
to
autonomously
predict,
prevent,
and
fix
issues
before
they
impact
the
business,
and
to
radically
improve
overall
operational
efficiency.
&nbsp;
Can
you
describe
how
Resolve
makes
it
easier
to
investigate
security
incidents?
Resolve’s
automated
incident
validation
quickly
determines
which
alarms
are
actual
threats
versus
those
that
are
simply
false
positives.
Hours
of
manual
effort
are
eliminated
by
automatically
collecting
data
across
the
IT
environment
and
security
tools,
including
SIEMs,
threat
feeds,
antivirus
systems,
and
logs.
All
of
that
data
gets
unified
into
a
customizable
dashboard,
so
it’s
easy
to
see
the
problem
and
determine
how
to
fix
it.
Resolve
centralizes
orchestration
of
the
end-to-end
triage
and
investigation
workflows
to
ensure
that
issues
can
be
addressed
quickly.
We
also
capture
a
full
audit
trail
of
incident
investigation
steps
and
results
to
support
compliance
and
governance.
&nbsp;
One
of
the
features
of
Resolve
is
it
enables
IT
professionals
to
ignore
‘noise’
to
focus
on
highlighted
real
problems.
Can
you
discuss
this?
IT
pros
are
bombarded
with
alarm
noise
coming
in
from
multiple
systems.
It’s
hard
to
know
where
to
focus
since
many
of
these
alarms
are
false
positives,
and
many
others
ultimately
derive
from
the
same
underlying
problem.
Take
for
example
the
case
of
an
e-commerce
system
failing.
Alarm
bells
will
start
ringing
everywhere
as
IT
pros
frantically
sort
through
multiple
data
sources
to
determine
whether
it’s
the
network,
application,
or
one
of
many
underlying
pieces
of
infrastructure
or
services
causing
the
problem.
It
could
take
hours
to
determine
that
the
culprit
was
high
CPU
utilization
that
led
to
a
slowing
database
and
ultimately
the
failure
of
the
e-commerce
system.
Even
worse,
with
all
of
the
alarm
noise,
the
IT
teams
might
miss
the
events
altogether
related
to
the
e-commerce
system
and
instead
focus
on
a
much
lower
priority
issue
that
isn’t
revenue
related.
Resolve
eliminates
alarm
noise
by
performing
event
correlation
and
clustering.
Clustering
machine
learning
algorithms
are
used
to
identify
and
group
events
(across
systems
and
domains)
that
usually
occur
together,
which
dramatically
compresses
event
volumes.
Our
platform
also
leverages
sequential
pattern
analysis
and
time-series
event
correlation.
Millions
of
events
across
applications
and
infrastructure
are
normalized
and
sequenced
in
a
time
series
and
then
analyzed
by
machine
learning
to
identify
patterns.
These
patterns
enable
Resolve
to
reduce
alarm
noise
and
help
pinpoint
root
cause
–
as
well
as
proactively
detect
problems
before
they
happen.
Additionally,
the
time-series
correlations
can
be
leveraged
to
playback
all
of
the
events
that
occurred
in
a
time
period
leading
up
to
an
outage.
In
the
case
of
the
e-commerce
example
above,
Resolve
would
be
able
to
cluster
all
of
the
alarms
related
to
the
application
failure,
compressing
those
into
a
single
event.
The
system
could
also
track
the
root
cause
back
to
a
spike
in
CPU
utilization,
making
it
fast
and
easy
for
the
IT
team
to
fix
the
issue
rather
than
triaging
hundreds
of
alarms
independently
as
they
look
under
every
rock
to
get
to
the
root
of
the
matter.
If
desired,
Resolve
can
even
trigger
an
automated
response
to
take
care
of
the
problem
autonomously
without
human
intervention.
&nbsp;
Can
you
give
us
a
case
study
of
how
an
enterprise
client
used
Resolve?
Fujitsu
had
a
range
of
drivers
for
adopting
automation
to
better
deliver
its
suite
of
IT
managed
services
to
a
wide
range
of
global
enterprises.
Chiefly,
Fujitsu
needed
to
bring
down
operational
costs
while
continuing
to
grow
their
infrastructure,
improve
organizational
efficiency
and
standardize
processes.
We
helped
them
achieve
all
of
those
goals
by
automating
key
processes,
and
we
helped
them
improve
MTTA
and
MTTR
to
ensure
they
were
quickly
addressing
issues
impacting
their
customers
to
meet
their
SLAs.
&nbsp;
Is
there
anything
else
that
you
would
like
to
share
about
Resolve?
Digital
transformation
has
gained
momentum
in
the
wake
of
the
global
pandemic.
We
see
an
incredible
need
to
alleviate
the
mounting
strain
on
IT
systems
and
staff
that
the
crisis
has
created.
Meanwhile,
it’s
also
apparent
that
businesses
need
to
be
planning
ahead
for
the
next
unexpected
event.
Automation
and
AIOps
are
both
fundamental
to
achieving
those
ends
as
they
can
help
safeguard
business
continuity
and
improve
agility
and
resilience
while
reducing
security
risks
and
cost.
Our
mission
is
to
help
our
customers
excel
even
during
challenging
times
by
strategically
leveraging
these
technologies.
Thank
you
for
your
wonderful
answers.
