Xsolla
is
taking
its
expertise
in
providing
billing
services
for
gaming
platforms
into
the
world
of
payments
and
commerce.
At
FinovateEurope
2015,
Xsolla
demonstrated
its
white-label,
customizable
billing
platform
for
financial
institutions.
Aiman
Seksembaeva,
Xsolla&#8217;s
manager
of
business
development,
said,
&#8220;We
believe
our
solution
has
been
perfected
and
molded
by
millions
of
daily
transactions
that
can
actually
help
reinvent
e-commerce.&#8221;
The
stats:
Founded
in
2006
Headquartered
in
Sherman
Oaks,
California
Maintains
workforce
of
170
Alexander
Agapitov
is
CEO
The
story
Xsolla&#8217;s
payment-gateway
comes
with
advanced
analytics
and
reporting
tools,
as
well
as
advanced
antifraud
and
chargeback
management.
The
technology
can
be
used
by
online
merchants
looking
to
make
it
easier
for
consumers
to
make
transactions
in
the
manner
and
currency
of
their
choice.
Xsolla
believes
this
flexibility
is
critical,
pointing
out
that
enabling
consumers
to
transact
in
local
currencies
increases
engagement
which
can
lead
to
higher
revenues
for
both
small
businesses
and
their
bank
partners.
Users
choose
a
country
and
coverage,
or
have
them
selected
automatically.
Some
advanced
users
of
the
platform
may
transact
in
one
set
of
currencies,
yet
want
payouts
in
an
entirely
different
set
of
currencies.
Seksembaeva
points
out
that
this
kind
of
functionality
within
larger
payment
gateways
has
been
available
for
years,
and
now
with
Xsolla,
these
options
are
available
to
small
and
medium-sized
merchants
as
well.
Banks
and
clients
alike
have
access
to
the
platform&#8217;s
analytic
and
reporting
dashboard,
a
24/7
analytics
suite
that
helps
merchants
monitor
and
manage
the
&#8220;flow
and
health
of
their
business.&#8221;
Users
can
see
all
transactions
made
on
the
platform,
the
volume
of
sales,
taxes
if
applicable,
payout
amounts
and
types,
and
review
fees,
courtesy
of
detailed
reports
on
each
payment
method.
The
bank
workspace,
Semsekbaeva
points
out,
is
not
just
a
&#8220;big-data
analytics
solution
capable
of
producing
customized
reports&#8221;
but
a
resource
that
allows
FIs
to
communicate
directly
with
clients.
It
can
be
used
for
cross-selling;
marketing
credit
lines
for
SMEs;
as
well
as
handling
complex
offers
from
merchants
and
other
vendors.
The
future
Xsolla
has
been
busy
making
friends
in
the
weeks
and
months
since
its
Finovate
debut
in
London
in
February.
The
company
announced
partnerships
with
Ubisoft
and
CipSoft
in
April,
following
a
string
of
successful
deals
from
late
2014.
Teaming
up
with
other
platforms
in
the
spring
has
led
to
sales
increases
of
more
than
30%
and
significant
gains
in
conversion
rates
from
PayPal,
credit
cards,
and
other
payment
methods.

Development

Seksembaeva

at
FinovateEurope
2015.
The
key
will
be
convincing
FIs
that
Xsolla,
which
already
has
a
strong
presence
in
the
world
of
online
gaming,
is
making
a
real
commitment
to
helping
banks
provide
a
range
of
options
for
their
small
business
clients
looking
for
variety
in
payment
options.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve
been
experiencing
a
lot
of
demand
from
businesses
for
a
solution
like
ours,&#8221;
Seksembaeva
said
of
the
company
technology.
&#8220;But
we
truly
believe
this
is
not
Xsolla&#8217;s
place
to
be.
This
is
a
bank&#8217;s
business.&#8221;

YapStone
Closes
$60
Million
Debt
Financing
Deal
By
David

<!--<div

Just
a
few
weeks
shy
of
its
Finovate
debut,
YapStone
has
secured
$60
million
in
debt
funding
courtesy
of
Comerica
Bank
and
Bregal
Sagemount.
The
online-
and
mobile-payment
technology
specialist
plans
to
use
the
capital
to
support
growth
in
existing
markets,
as
well
as
to
support
initiatives
in
new
markets
and
new
verticals.
&#8220;Our
mission
since
we
founded
the
company
has
been
to
change
how
the
world
pays
in
huge
vertical
markets,&#8221;
said
YapStone
CEO
and
Chairman
Tom
Villante.
&#8220;I
strongly
believe
we&#8217;re
just
scratching
the
surface.&#8221;
Previous
to
this
most
recent
round,
YapStone
had
raised
just
over
$50
million
in
equity
capital
via
a
venture
round
in
2009,
and
another
in
2011.
Comerica
Bank
has
had
a
long
relationship
with
YapStone,
more
than
a
decade
according
to
Alan
Jepsen,
Comerica
SVP
and
managing
director
for
technology
and
life
sciences.
Bregal
Sagemount,
by
contrast,
is
a
newer
partner.
Speaking
of
his
company&#8217;s
new
relationship
with
YapStone,
Clayton
Main,
head
of
credit
at
Bregal
Sagemount,
says
that
YapStone
has
&#8220;established
itself
as
the
go-to
provider
for
payments
in
several
massive
vertical
markets
and
online
marketplaces.&#8221;
YapStone
was
founded
in
1999,
and
is
headquartered
in
Walnut
Creek,
California.
The
company&#8217;s
platform
drives
electronic
payments
for
marketplaces
such
as
HomeAway
and
VRBO,
and
is
used
in
a
variety
of
verticals
ranging
from
apartment
and
vacation
rentals
to
nonprofit
organizations.
The
company
processes
more
than
$14
billion
in
payment
volume
each
year,
and
has
been
recognized
by
Inc.
Magazine
as
one
of
the
Fastest
Growing
Private
Companies
for
each
of
the
last
seven
years.
Come
see
and
meet
YapStone
at
FinovateSpring
2015
in
San
Jose.
The
conference
is
held
12/13
May
2015.
