Return
Of
The
Prodigal
Economy
-
Will
Rising
Yields
Hurt
The
‘Stimmy’
Trade?
In
many
ways,
the
bond
market
is
the
magnetic
field
of
the
financial
system
–
when
it
is
destabilised,
other
markets
and
broad
economies
suffer.The
speedy
rise
in
bond
yields
is
a
revolt
against
central
banks,
a
sign
that
inflation
is
on
the
way
back
and
a
warning
that
more
volatility
is
ahead.
