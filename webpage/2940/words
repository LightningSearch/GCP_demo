Note:
Forbes
may
earn
a
commission
on
sales
made
from
partner
links
on
this
page,
but
that
doesn't
affect
our
editors'
opinions
or
evaluations.
Many
personal
loans
can
be
used
to
fund
common
family
expenses
like
home
improvement
projects,
wedding
expenses,
vacations
and,
in
some
cases,
even
the
purchase
of
land.
Borrowers
also
turn
to
personal
loans
for
debt
consolidation
,
because
interest
rates
are
often
lower
for
personal
loans
than
for
credit
cards
—especially
for
applicants
with
good
to
excellent
credit.
These
loans
are
available
from
traditional
banks,
credit
unions
and
online
lending
platforms
that
make
it
easy
to
apply
online—without
having
to
visit
a
bank
branch.
What’s
more,
many
personal
loans
can
be
funded
within
a
few
business
days
so
you
don’t
have
to
wait
to
get
the
money
you
need.
The
best
personal
loans
offer
low
interest
rates
for
well-qualified
borrowers,
flexible
loan
amounts
and
repayment
terms
and
limited
fees.

Why
We
Picked
It
SoFi
is
an
online
lending
platform
that
offers
unsecured
fixed-rate
personal
loans
in
every
state
except
Mississippi.
Founded
in
2011,
SoFi
has
extended
over
$50
billion
in
loans
and
stands
out
for
allowing
high
loan
amounts
and
its
availability
of
extended
loan
terms.
Loans
are
available
between
$5,000
and
$100,000,
making
SoFi
a
great
option
for
those
with
excellent
credit
who
need
to
borrow
a
large
amount
of
money.
Loan
amounts
available
may
vary
by
the
state
you
live
in.
Repayment
terms
range
from
two
to
seven
years,
making
SoFi
an
incredibly
flexible
option
for
those
with
sufficient
credit
(minimum
680)
and
annual
income
(at
least
$45,000).
SoFi
also
lets
prospective
borrowers
submit
joint
applications—although
co-signers
are
not
permitted.
Approved
borrowers
are
rewarded
with
comparatively
low
APRs.
What’s
more,
SoFi
doesn’t
charge
origination
fees,
late
fees
or
prepayment
penalties—a
stand-out
feature
because
personal
loan
lenders
often
charge
origination
or
late
payment
fees
at
a
minimum.
However,
if
you’re
considering
a
debt
consolidating
loan
from
SoFi,
keep
in
mind
that
the
lender
does
not
offer
direct
payment
to
a
borrower’s
other
creditors.
This
means
the
loan
proceeds
will
be
deposited
to
your
bank
account
and
you’ll
have
to
pay
off
your
other
lenders
individually.
The
platform
does
offer
customers
a
number
of
other
perks
and
discounts,
including
unemployment
protection
and
the
ability
to
change
their
payment
due
date
once
a
year.
Extra
Details
Eligibility:
 
Personal
loan
applicants
should
have
a
minimum
credit
score
of
680.
However,
many
successful
applicants
have
a
score
of
700
or
higher.
Applicants
also
must
have
an
annual
income
of
at
least
$45,000,
though
the
average
income
of
a
SoFi
borrower
is
over
$100,000.
Loan
uses:
 
In
general,
SoFi
personal
loans
are
limited
to
use
for
personal,
family
and
household
purposes.
This
means
a
borrower
can
use
loan
funds
to
cover
things
like
medical
costs,
credit
card
consolidation,
home
improvements
and
relocation
costs.
However,
SoFi
loans
cannot
be
used
to
fund
a
new
business
venture,
the
purchase
of
real
estate,
investments
and
securities,
post-secondary
education
or
short-term
bridge
financing.
Turnaround
time: 
Borrowers
typically
receive
funds
within
a
few
days—or
as
soon
as
the
next
business
day
after
approval
and
acceptance
of
terms.
However,
funding
times
may
be
longer
than
a
few
days—especially
for
loans
over
$20,000.
Pros
Prequalification
with
soft
credit
check
Funding
in
as
little
as
one
to
two
days
High
loan

and
lengthy
terms

Why
We
Picked
It
LightStream
is
a
consumer
lending
division
of
Truist—which
formed
following
the
merger
of
SunTrust
Bank
and
BB&amp;T.
The
platform
offers
unsecured
personal
loans
from
as
little
as
$5,000
up
to
$100,000.
Loan
amounts
vary
based
on
the
loan
purpose.
Although
a
number
of
lenders
offer
smaller
loans
than
the
LightStream
minimum,
few
lenders
offer
a
higher
maximum
loan.
Repayment
terms
are
available
from
two
to
seven
years,
making
it
an
excellent
option
for
those
who
want
to
spread
out
the
payment
of
large
expenses
over
time.
In
addition
to
offering
appealing
and
flexible
terms,
LightStream
charges
no
origination,
late
payment
or
prepayment
fees.
The
lender
also
offers
a
0.50%
rate
discount
for
borrowers
who
enroll
in
autopay—higher
than
most
lenders
with
the
same
perk—as
well
as
a
30-day
loan
experience
guarantee
to
ensure
borrower
satisfaction,
Covid-19/hardship
assistance
and
a
rate-beat
program.
LightStream
will
beat
a
competitor’s
interest
rate
by
0.1%
for
applicants
who
meet
certain
criteria.
LightStream
offers
loans
in
all
50
states
plus
Washington,
D.C.
and
Puerto
Rico,
and
applicants
can
contact
the
lender’s
customer
support
team
seven
days
a
week;
current
borrowers
have
access
to
customer
support
from
Monday
through
Saturday.
And,
while
LightStream
doesn’t
offer
a
mobile
app
for
loan
management,
customers
can
access
their
account
through
LightStream.com.
Extra
Details
Eligibility: 
LightStream
recommends
applicants
have
good
to
excellent
credit
before
applying
for
a
personal
loan.
To
increase
their
chances
of
approval,
applicants
also
should
have
several
years
of
credit
history,
including
multiple
account
types,
as
well
as
an
income
that
is
stable
enough
to
service
current
debts
and
a
new
LightStream
loan.
LightStream
doesn’t
give
prospective
borrowers
the
ability
to
prequalify
for
a
loan
.
This
fact—combined
with
the
minimum
credit
score
requirement—makes
the
platform
a
better
fit
for
those
with
a
strong
credit
profile.
Applicants
with
excellent
credit
also
are
more
likely
to
get
favorable
terms.
LightStream
does
not
allow
co-signers,
but
prospective
borrowers
can
submit
a
joint
application.
Loan
uses:
 
LightStream’s
personal
loans
can
be
used
for
a
wide
range
of
purposes,
from
purchasing
a
new
car,
RV
or
jewelry
to
paying
for
home
improvements.
However,
LightStream
really
stands
out,
because
loans
can
be
used
to
finance
land,
timeshares
and
so-called
tiny
homes.
As
with
other
top
lenders,
LightStream
prohibits
use
of
its
personal
loans
for
post-secondary
education
costs,
business
purposes
and
illegal
activities.
Borrowers
also
are
prohibited
from
using
LightStream
loan
funds
to
refinance
an
existing
LightStream
loan.
Turnaround
time:
 
LightStream
borrowers
can
receive
funds
as
soon
as
the
same
day
if
the
loan
is
approved
before
2:30
p.m.
Eastern
time
on
a
banking
business
day.
To
receive
same-day
funding,
the
applicant
also
must
review
and
electronically
sign
the
loan
agreement;
provide
LightStream
with
funding
preferences
and
relevant
banking
information;
and
complete
the
final
verification
process—all
before
2:30
p.m.
on
the
day
the
loan
is
approved.
Pros
No
origination,

Why
We
Picked
It
Marcus
by
Goldman
Sachs
is
a
subsidiary
of
the
investment
bank
Goldman
Sachs
and
offers
personal
loans
between
$3,500
and
$40,000.
While
Marcus
may
not
be
the
ideal
choice
for
those
who
need
access
to
a
large
loan
amount,
the
platform
still
offers
rather
flexible
loans
that
are
available
for
three-
to
six-year
terms.
Borrowers
can
access
APRs
between
6.99%
and
19.99%
with
a
0.25%
discount
for
autopay
enrollees.
And,
like
some
other
top
lenders,
Marcus
doesn’t
charge
any
fees,
including
for
sign-up,
late
payment
and
prepayment.
Plus,
borrowers
can
benefit
from
the
platform’s
on-time
payment
reward
and
flexible
payment
dates.
As
with
many
other
top
lenders,
Marcus
lets
applicants
prequalify
with
a
soft
credit
pull,
so
it’s
easy
to
see
your
loan
options
without
hurting
your
credit.
While
Marcus
customers
don’t
have
access
to
a
mobile
app
for
managing
their
loans,
the
lender
makes
up
for
the
lost
convenience
with
robust
customer
support
options.
Borrowers
can
contact
customer
support
seven
days
a
week
from
9
a.m.
to
7
p.m.
Eastern
time
and
have
access
to
extensive
online
resources.
Extra
Details
Eligibility:
 
Marcus
does
not
disclose
the
minimum
required
credit
score,
but
applicants
should
have
a
minimum
score
of
660.
Those
with
higher
scores
are
eligible
for
lower
rates
and
more
favorable
terms.
And,
while
Marcus
doesn’t
disclose
an
income
requirement,
the
platform
does
require
applicants
to
have
an
income
sufficient
to
cover
loan
repayment.
In
contrast
to
some
personal
loan
providers,
Marcus
does
not
permit
co-signers
or
co-applicants.
Loan
uses:
 
Marcus’
personal
loans
can
be
used
for
debt
consolidation,
home
improvement,
moving
and
relocation,
special
events,
travel
and
vacations
and
more.
Borrowers
cannot
use
Marcus
personal
loans
to
refinance
existing
student
loans,
but
the
platform
supports
other
forms
of
debt
consolidation
with
a
consolidation
calculator
and
direct
payment
to
third-party
lenders.
Turnaround
time:
 
An
applicant’s
loan
may
be
approved
in
under
24
hours—quicker
than
some
lenders,
but
not
the
fastest
approval
process
we
encountered.
Once
a
loan
is
approved,
funds
take
between
one
and
four
days
after
bank
account
verification
to
land
in
the
borrower’s
account.
However,
funding
time
varies
depending
on
the
financial
institution
and
when
the
loan
was
processed.
Pros
No
origination,
late
payment,
insufficient
fund
or
prepayment
fees
Offers
direct

payments
to

lenders
Borrowers
can

Why
We
Picked
It
Upgrade
was
launched
in
2017
and
provides
accessible
online
and
mobile
credit
and
banking
services
in
every
state
except
Iowa,
Vermont
and
West
Virginia.
Since
that
time,
the
platform
has
made
more
than
$3
billion
in
credit
available
to
over
10
million
applicants
and
continues
to
expand
its
online
and
mobile
services.
Although
maximum
APRs
are
on
the
high
end
compared
to
other
online
lenders,
Upgrade
makes
loans
available
to
those
with
poor
credit
history.
Loans
amounts,
which
start
at
just
$1,000,
are
flexible
but
cap
out
at
$35,000—lower
than
lenders
that
focus
on
lower-risk
borrowers.
Three-
and
five-year
loan
terms
are
available.
Upgrade
charges
an
origination
fee
between
2.9%
and
8%
of
the
loan,
and
borrowers
will
encounter
a
$10
fee
if
their
payment
is
more
than
15
days
late
or
if
the
payment
does
not
go
through;
there
are
no
discounts
for
autopay.
That
said,
Upgrade
borrowers
are
not
subject
to
a
prepayment
penalty,
so
you
can
reduce
the
overall
cost
of
the
loan
if
you’re
able
to
pay
it
off
early.
Beyond
offering
accessible
personal
loans,
Upgrade
streamlines
the
lending
process
with
a
mobile
app
that
lets
borrowers
view
their
balance,
make
payments
and
update
personal
information.
Upgrade’s
Credit
Heath
tool
also
makes
it
easy
to
track
your
credit
score
over
the
life
of
your
loan.
Extra
Details
Eligibility:
 
Prospective
borrowers
should
have
a
minimum
score
of
580
to
qualify
for
an
Upgrade
personal
loan
(the
average
borrower
score
is
697),
making
it
an
accessible
option
for
those
with
fair
credit.
Furthermore,
the
lender
does
not
require
applicants
to
meet
a
minimum
income
requirement,
although
borrowers
make
$95,000
per
year
on
average.
Applicants
should
have
a
maximum
pre-loan
debt-to-income
ratio
of
45%,
excluding
their
mortgage.
The
lender
also
considers
each
applicant’s
free
cash
flow,
which
demonstrates
their
likely
ability
to
make
consistent
on-time
loan
payments.
Ideally,
applicants
should
have
a
minimum
monthly
cash
flow
of
$800.
Upgrade
increases
loan
accessibility
by
also
allowing
co-applicants.
Loan
uses:
 
As
with
most
other
personal
loans,
loans
from
Upgrade
must
be
used
to
pay
off
credit
cards,
consolidate
other
debt,
make
home
improvements
or
pay
for
other
large
purchases.
However,
Upgrade
stands
out
from
some
lenders
by
allowing
borrowers
to
use
personal
loan
funds
to
cover
business
expenses.
What’s
more,
Upgrade
will
directly
pay
off
third-party
lenders,
making
debt
consolidation
more
convenient
than
with
some
competing
lenders.
There
are
no
specific
prohibitions
on
the
use
of
Upgrade
loans
other
than
those
already
imposed
by
law.
Turnaround
time:
 
Once
an
Upgrade
loan
is
approved,
it
generally
takes
up
to
four
business
days
for
a
borrower
to
receive
the
funds.
However,
if
Upgrade
is
directly
paying
off
a
borrower’s
loans
to
a
third-party
lender,
it
can
take
up
to
two
weeks
for
the
funds
to
clear.

Why
We
Picked
It
Founded
in
2012
and
based
in
Chicago,
Avant
is
a
consumer
lending
platform
that
offers
secured
and
unsecured
personal
loans
through
a
third-party
bank
(WebBank).
Unsecured
loans
are
available
in
Wasington,
D.C.
and
every
state
but
Hawaii,
Louisiana,
Nevada
and
South
Carolina.
The
platform
specializes
in
middle-income
borrowers
with
fair
to
good
credit
and
only
requires
a
minimum
score
of
580
to
qualify.
Maximum
loan
amounts
are
low
compared
to
other
lenders,
but
the
low
minimum
amount
and
flexible
repayment
terms
(two
to
five
years)
make
it
an
accessible
option
for
borrowers.
However,
as
with
many
loans
for
subprime
borrowers,
Avant
personal
loans
come
with
a
price.
In
addition
to
charging
an
administrative
fee
of
up
to
4.75%
of
the
loan
amount,
Avant’s
APR
range
(9.95%
to
35.99%)
is
on
the
high
end
for
applicants
with
a
good
to
excellent
credit
score—and
there
is
no
autopay
discount.
Still,
the
platform
earns
top
marks
for
borrowers
with
less
than
stellar
credit
who
need
quick
access
to
funds.
It’s
also
worth
noting
that
Avant
agreed
to
a
$3.85
million
settlement
with
the
Federal
Trade
Commission
(FTC)
in
April
2019.
According
to
FTC
documents,
the
lawsuit
was
filed
in
response
to
allegations
that,
among
other
things,
Avant
charged
consumers
late
fees
and
interest
they
didn’t
owe
and
collected
payments
from
customers
without
permission
or
in
amounts
larger
than
authorized.
We
reached
out
to
Avant
to
find
out
what
they’ve
done
to
adjust
practices
since
the
settlement
but
did
not
receive
a
response.
Even
so,
Avant
has
a
high
4.7
star
rating
on
Trustpilot.
Extra
Details
Eligibility:
 
Avant
aims
to
provide
credit
services
to
a
range
of
customers,
including
those
with
fair
credit.
For
that
reason,
Avant
has
a
minimum
credit
score
requirement
of
580,
with
the
average
borrower
score
between
600
and
700.
Likewise,
Avant
focuses
on
low-
to
middle-income
borrowers
and
has
a
minimum
income
requirement
of
just
$20,000,
though
most
borrowers
have
an
average
household
income
of
$40,000
to
$100,000.
To
expand
eligibility,
Avant
also
will
consider
more
than
just
your
employment
income,
including
alimony
and
child
support,
and
may
include
the
income
of
other
people
within
your
household.
That
said,
Avant
does
not
allow
co-signers
or
co-applicants.
Loan
uses:
 
As
with
many
other
personal
loan
providers,
Avant
loans
can
be
used
to
consolidate
debt
and
pay
for
things
like
medical
expenses,
auto
repairs,
home
improvements
moving
or
vacations
and
travel.
Avant
borrowers
cannot
use
personal
loan
funds
to
cover
business
expenses,
but
the
platform
does
allow
current
borrowers
to
refinance
their
existing
Avant
loans
with
another
loan—possibly
with
a
lower
APR.

Why
We
Picked
It
Discover
is
an
online
bank
that
also
offers
customers
credit
cards,
retirement
solutions
and
personal
loans
in
all
50
states.
As
a
lending
platform,
Discover
stands
out
because
of
its
online
application
and
mobile
banking
tools,
well-reviewed
customer
support
team
and
quick
funding.
In
general,
loans
are
available
from
$2,500
to
$35,000
and
may
be
issued
for
between
three
and
seven
years.
So,
while
borrowers
may
get
a
larger
loan
from
another
lender,
the
repayment
terms
are
fairly
flexible.
Discover
charges
a
late
payment
fee
and
does
not
offer
an
autopay
discount;
however,
it
does
not
charge
any
origination
fees
or
prepayment
penalties,
making
it
competitive
with
other
top
personal
loan
providers.
It’s
worth
noting
that
Discover
has
a
low
1.9-star
rating
on
Trustpilot.
However,
the
majority
of
these
reviews
are
from
credit
card
and
banking
customers—specifically,
there
are
reports
that
Discover
is
closing
credit
accounts
in
the
wake
of
Covid-19.
Some
negative
loan
reviews
also
mention
high
interest
rates
that
make
it
difficult
to
pay
off
loan
balances.
Overall,
however,
an
online
customer
survey
conducted
by
Discover
revealed
that
81%
of
customers
reported
saving
money
by
consolidating
debt
with
a
Discover
personal
loan;
77%
of
debt
consolidation
customers
reported
feeling
less
stressed
after
taking
out
a
Discover
personal
loan.

Eligibility:
 
Prospective
borrowers
must
have
a

of
660
to
qualify
for
a
Discover
personal
loan,
but
the
average
Discover
borrower
has
a
score
of
750.
Discover
does
not
require
applicants
to
have
a

Applicants
also
must
demonstrate
a
minimum
household
income
of
$25,000
per
year,
though
an
average
income
is
not
disclosed.
Discover
also
evaluates
each
applicant’s
credit
history,
recent
credit
activities
and
other
credit
inquiries.
Co-signers
and
co-applicants
are
not
permitted.
Loan
uses: 
Discover
personal
loans
can
be
used
for
financial
emergencies,
medical
bills,
adoption
and
fertility
costs,
auto
repairs
and
pet
emergencies.
Unlike
some
other
personal
loan
providers,
Discover
loans
can
also
be
used
to
cover
small-business
expenses.
Customers
cannot
use
a
Discover
loan
to
pay
for
post-secondary
education,
to
pay
off
a
secured
loan
or
for
illegal
activity.
Turnaround
time:
 
Applicants
generally
receive
a
same-day
decision.
If
approved,
funds
may
be
sent
as
soon
as
the
next
business
day
if
the
loan
was
funded
on
a
week
day—and
if
there
aren’t
any
typos
or
errors
in
the
application.
Otherwise,
borrowers
may
not
receive
loan
funds
for
up
to
seven
days.
Discover
also
can
disperse
funds
directly
to
third-party
creditors

Why
We
Picked
It
LendingClub
is
a
peer-to-peer—or
marketplace—lender
founded
in
2007.
As
the
largest
online
lending
platform
for
personal
loans,
LendingClub
has
worked
with
over
3
million
customers
and
funded
more
than
$55
billion
in
loans.
It’s
also
one
of
the
most
geographically
widespread
options,
with
lending
capabilities
in
every
state
except
Iowa
and
the
U.S.
territories.
While
LendingClub
imposes
high
APRs
and
no
autopay
discount,
applicants
can
choose
to
borrow
as
little
as
$1,000.
So
you
won’t
have
to
borrow—and
pay
interest
on—more
than
you
need.
And,
though
borrowers
are
limited
to
$40,000,
this
is
a
higher
cap
than
some
other
lenders.
That
said,
LendingClub’s
loan
terms
are
limited
to
three
or
five
years,
which
is
less
flexible
than
other
lenders
on
our
list.
Borrowers
also
are
charged
an
origination
fee
between
2%
and
6%
of
the
total
loan
amount,
which
is
taken
from
the
loan
proceeds
at
funding.
LendingClub
also
makes
debt
consolidation
easier
by
offering
a
balance
transfer
loan.
With
this
type
of
loan,
LendingClub
offers
direct
payment
to
third-party
lenders,
including
over
1,700
creditors.
Not
only
does
the
platform
take
care
of
payments
for
you,
you
can
choose
exactly
how
much
of
your
new
loan
amount
you
want
LendingClub
to
pay
toward
each
creditor.
Extra
Details
Eligibility: 
Applicants
must
have
a
minimum
credit
score
of
600
and
a
minimum
credit
history
of
three
years
to
qualify
for
a
LendingClub
loan.
Furthermore,
applicants
should
have
a
debt-to-income
ratio
of
less
than
40%
for
single
applicants
and
35%
for
joint
applicants.
These
factors,
including
proof
of
income,
help
LendingClub’s
platform
of
investors
decide
who
they
want
to
lend
to.
Co-applicants
are
permitted
but
co-signers
are
not
an
option
for
LendingClub
borrowers.
Loan
uses: 
Loans
issued
through
LendingClub
can
be
used
for
more
major
expenses,
including
debt
and
credit
card
consolidation,
home
repairs,
medical
bills
and
special
events.
LendingClub
also
makes
it
easy
to
consolidate
debt
by
offering
direct
payment
to
third
party
creditors.
Borrowers
are
restricted
from
using
funds
for
postsecondary
education,
the
purchase
of
investments,
gambling
and
illegal
activities.
Turnaround
time:
 
LendingClub
borrowers
typically
receive
their
loan
funds
as
soon
as
four
days
after
loan
approval.
However,
this
timeline
may
vary
if
an
application
is
complete
or
if
the
lender
requires
additional
documentation
or
verification.

Why
We
Picked
It
Upstart
has
made
a
mark
on
the
personal
loan
space
because
of
its
artificial
intelligence-
and
machine
learning-based
approach
to
borrower
qualification.
In
fact,
Upstart
estimates
that
it
has
been
able
to
approve
27%
more
borrowers
than
possible
under
a
traditional
lending
model.
With
competitive
APRs,
Upstart
is
not
a
top
lender
for
borrowers
who
can
qualify
for
more
competitive
rates.
Even
so,
the
platform’s
minimum
600
credit
score
makes
it
an
accessible
option
to
those
with
fair
credit.
Upstart
also
offers
a
pretty
flexible
range
of
loan
options,
with
amounts
ranging
from
as
low
as
$1,000
so
you
don’t
have
to
borrow
(or
pay
interest
on)
more
than
you
really
need.
And,
while
Upstart’s
loans
cap
out
at
$50,000—lower
than
some
lenders—this
is
likely
to
be
enough
for
many
prospective
borrowers.
Even
though
Upstarts
three-
and
five-year
loan
terms
are
more
restrictive
than
other
lenders,
it’s
likely
to
be
an
acceptable
tradeoff
for
applicants
who
might
not
be
approved
in
a
more
traditional
lending
environment.
Plus,
it’s
available
in
every
state
except
West
Virginia
and
Iowa,
so
it’s
as
widely
available
as
many
other
top
lenders.
Extra
Details
Eligibility:
 
Upstart
stands
out
because
it
uses
an
AI-based
platform
to
consider
a
range
of
non-conventional
variables
when
evaluating
borrower
applications.
And,
while
the
platform
advertises
a
minimum
credit
score
of
600,
Upstart
may

accept
applicants

When
evaluating
prospective
borrowers,
Upstart
considers
college
education,
job
history,
residence,
debt-to-income
ratio
,
bankruptcies
and
delinquencies
and
number
of
credit
inquiries.
Borrowers
also
must
have
a
full-time
job
or
offer
starting
in
six
months,
a
regular
part-time
job
or
another
source
of
regular
income—with
a
minimum
annual
income
of
$12,000.
Co-signers
and
co-applicants
are
not
permitted.
Loan
uses:
 
Upstart’s
personal
loans
can
be
used
for
credit
card
and
other
debt
consolidation,
special
events,
moving
and
relocation,
medical
and
dental
costs
and
home
improvements.
In
contrast
to
many
other
traditional
and
online
lenders,
Upstart
also
lets
borrowers
use
personal
loan
funds
to
cover
educational
expenses
(except
in
California,
Connecticut,
Illinois,
Washington
and
the
District
of
Columbia).
Upstart

cannot
use
personal
loans
to
finance
illegal
activity
or
purchase
weapons,
firearms
or
illegal
drugs.

Why
We
Picked
It
Founded
in
2009,
Payoff
is
an
online
lending
platform
that
connects
prospective
borrowers
with
fixed-rate
credit
card
debt
consolidation
loans
in
every
state
except
Massachusetts,
Mississippi,
Nebraska
and
Nevada.
Though
Payoff
only
offers
loans
for
credit
card
debt
consolidation,
it’s
a
top
choice
for
borrowers
with
fair
to
good
credit,
with
more
qualified
applicants
able
to
access
the
platform’s
lowest
rates.
Plus,
applicants
can
complete
a
prequalification
process
to
see
what
kind
of
rates
they
qualify
for
without
damaging
their
credit.
Payoff
offers
pretty
flexible
lending
terms
(two
to
five
years)
and
borrowers
can
borrow
as
little
as
$5,000
or
as
much
as
$40,000,
depending
on
the
credit
card
balances
they
need
to
consolidate.
Rates
are
relatively
competitive
on
the
low
end
(5.99%)
and
the
highest
possible
rate
(24.99%)
is
still
lower
than
some
other
lenders
that
cater
to
borrowers
with
fair
credit.
However,
like
some
lenders,
Payoff
does
not
offer
an
autopay
discount.
And,
while
Payoff
charges
a
0%
to
5%
origination
fee,
there
are
no
late
fees,
annual
fees
or
prepayment
penalties.
Finally,
while
Payoff
does
not
offer
borrowers
a
mobile
app,
the
platform’s
customer
support
team
is
available
seven
days
a
week
so
it’s
easy
to
get
in
touch
when
you
need
to.
Payoff
also
features
a
support
center
and
FAQs
page—both
of
which
offer
a
ton
of
helpful
resources
for
prospective
and
current
borrowers.
Extra
Details
Eligibility: 
Prospective
Payoff
borrowers
should
have
a
minimum
credit
score
of
640

also
have

zero
current
delinquencies,
a
minimum
annual
income
of
$40,000
and
a
debt-to-income
ratio
under
50%.
The
platform
also
will
evaluate
each
applicant’s
credit
utilization
ratio
and
current
lines
of
credit.
Payoff
does
not
offer
borrowers
a
co-signer
option,
so
applicants
must
qualify
based
on
their
individual
financial
circumstances.
Loan
uses:
 
Payoff
only
offers
loans
for
credit
card
debt
consolidation,
making
this
the
most
limited
lending
platform
on
our
list
of
the
best
personal
loans.
Turnaround
time:
 
After
submitting
an
application
and
all
the
necessary
documents,
underwriting
may
take
three
to
seven
business
days.
After
getting
approved
and
signing
the
paperwork,
you
will
receive
the

within
three

according
to
a

Why
We
Picked
It
A
sister
company
to
Rocket
Homes
and
Rocket
Mortgage
by
Quicken
Loans,
Rocket
Loans
offers
personal
loans
through
Cross
River
Bank.
The
lender’s
availability
in
most
states
and
low
minimum
credit
score
requirement
make
Rocket
Loans
an
accessible
option.
However,
borrowers
will
face
origination
fees
and
repayment
terms
limited
to
three
or
five
years.
Rocket
Loans
may
be
a
good
option
if
you
have
a
fair
credit
score
(580
or
higher)
and
want
funds
fast.
However,
the
platform
charges
an
origination
fee
between
1%
and
6%
of
the
loan
amount
and
APRs
range
from
7.161%
to
29.99%,
so
cheaper
loan
options
may
be
available,
depending
on
your
creditworthiness.
Overall,
Rocket
Loans
stands
out
because
of
the
low
credit
score
requirement
and
potentially
fast
funding
time.
The
platform
also
makes
it
easy
to
manage
personal
loans
with
the
user
dashboard
and
customer
support
team,
which
is
available
Monday
through
Saturday.
Extra
Details
Eligibility:
 
Prospective
Rocket
Loans
borrowers
must
have
a
minimum
credit
score
of
580
to
qualify
for
a
personal
loan;
however,
the
average
borrower
score
is
710.
Borrowers
also
should
have
a
minimum
credit
history
of
two
years.
That
said,
the
average
credit
history
of
a
Rocket

borrower
is
much
longer—18
years.
Finally,
Rocket

requires
borrowers
to
have
a
minimum

of
$24,000
and
a
maximum
debt-to-income
ratio
of

but

respectively.
Rocket

does
not

Loan
uses:
 
Rocket

borrowers
can
use
personal

funds
for

they
complete
their

and

This

Tips
for
Comparing
Personal
Loans
Consider
these
tips
when
comparing
personal
loans:
Where
possible,
prequalify.
Many
personal
loan
providers
offer
prospective
borrowers
the
ability
to
prequalify
for
a
loan.
This
means
the
applicant
can
submit
details
about
their
financing
needs,
income,
housing
situation
and
other
relevant
information
to
find
out
what
kind
of
loan
amounts,
rates
and
repayment
terms
they
are
likely
to
qualify
for.
Even
better,
this
process
typically
only
requires
a
soft
credit
inquiry
so
you
can
shop
around
without
hurting
your
credit
score.
Consider
the
purpose
of
your
loan.
While
personal
loans
can
be
used
for
a
pretty
broad
range
of
purposes,
they
are
limited
to
things
like
consumer
debt
consolidation,
home
improvements,
vacations,
weddings,
funerals,
large
purchases
and
other
personal
expenses.
For
that
reason,
lenders
often
restrict
the
use
of
personal
loans
for
postsecondary
education
expenses,
business
purposes
and
illegal
activities,
at
a
minimum.
When
considering
a
lender,
confirm
that
your
intended
use
of
the
loan
is
permissible
under
its
borrower
agreement.
Keep
an
eye
out
for
additional
fees.
Some
lenders
offer
fee-free
personal
loans
that
don’t
require
borrowers
to
pay
origination
fees
,
late
payment
fees,
prepayment
penalties
or
any
other
common
loan
costs.
However,
this
is
more
the
exception
than
the
rule,
so
it’s
important
to
ask
about
fees
when
shopping
for
the
best
loan
terms.
And,
if
a
lender
charges
an
origination
fee,
find
out
whether
it’s
built
into
the
APR
or
taken
out
of
the
loan
amount
prior
to
funding,
as
this
may
impact
the
loan
amount
you
need
to
request.
Evaluate
the
lender’s
customer
support
options.
If
you’ve
found
a
lender
that’s
prepared
to
offer
the
money
you
need
at
acceptable
terms,
there’s
one
more
thing
to
consider
before
signing
the
loan
agreement.
While
customer
support
may
not
seem
like
a
big
deal
in
the
honeymoon
phase
of
your
loan,
it
can
make
a
huge
difference
if
you
encounter
issues
with
payments
or
face
a
financial
hardship
during
your
repayment
period.
Review
the
lender’s
customer
service
resources
and
read
reviews
from
past
and
current
borrowers
to
make
sure
it’s
a
good
fit.
Methodology
We
reviewed
15
popular
lenders
based
on
16
data
points
in
the
categories
of
loan
details,
loan
costs,
eligibility
and
accessibility,
customer
experience
and
the
application
process.
We
chose
the
10
best
lenders
based
on
the
weighting
assigned
to
each
category:
Loan
details:
20%
Loan
cost:
35%
Eligibility
and
accessibility:
20%
Customer
experience:
15%
Application
process:
10%
Within
each
major
category,
we
also
considered
several
characteristics,
including
available
loan
amounts,
repayment
terms,
APR
ranges
and
applicable
fees.
We
also
looked
at
minimum
credit
score
requirements,
whether
each
lender
accepts
co-signers
or
joint
applications
and
the
geographic
availability
of
the
lender.
Finally,
we
evaluated
each
provider’s
customer
support
tools,
borrower
perks
and
features
that
simplify
the
borrowing
process—like
prequalification
options
and
mobile
apps.
Where
appropriate,
we
awarded
partial
points
depending
on
how
well
a
lender
met
each
criterion.

FAQs
How
hard
is
it
to
qualify
for
a
personal
loan?
Borrower
qualifications
for
personal
loans
vary
by
lender.
In
general,
an
applicant
will
need
at
least
a
fair
credit
score
(580
to
669
on
the
FICO
scale)
to
qualify—although
it
is
possible
to
get
a
personal
loan
with
bad
credit
.
That
said,
borrowers
with
good
to
excellent
scores
will
qualify
for
the
lowest
interest
rates,
larger
loan
amounts
and
more
flexible
repayment
terms.
&nbsp;
Many
lenders
offer
a
prequalification
process
that
lets
you
find
out
which
loans
and
terms
you
qualify
for
based
on
a
soft
credit
inquiry.
This
is
a
great
way
to
shop
for
the
most
favorable
personal
loans
without
negatively
impacting
your
credit
score.
How
are
APRs
determined
for
personal
loans?
An
annual
percentage
rate
—or
APR—is
the
total
annual
cost
of
a
loan,
over
the
life
of
the
loan.
Stated
another
way,
it’s
the
total
cost
of
credit
based
on
the
interest
rate,
fees
and
length
of
the
repayment
term.
Some
lenders
include
origination
fees
in
the
advertised
APRs,
while
others
take
them
out
of
the
loan
amount
at
funding.
The
APR
of
a
personal
loan,
therefore,
will
vary
depending
on
your
creditworthiness,
the
size
of
the
loan,
how
long
you
have
to
repay
the
loan
and
the
lender.
What
fees
should
I
look
out
for
when
choosing
a
personal
loan?
Common
fees
associated
with
personal
loans
include
origination
fees,
late
payment
fees
and
returned
check
fees.
Some
lenders
also
charge
a
prepayment
penalty
to
borrowers
who
opt
to
pay
off
their
loans
early.
Keep
in
mind,
however,
that
many
lenders
offer
a
no-fee
structure
that
can
reduce
costs
over
the
life
of
your
loan—so
it’s
important
to
always
shop
around
for
the
most
favorable
loan
terms.
What
can
I
use
a
personal
loan
for?
In
general,
personal
loans
are
restricted
to
use
for
just
that—personal
uses.
Lenders
typically
extend
personal
loans
to
borrowers
who
want
to
finance
things
like
home
improvement,
travel
and
vacations,
weddings,
car-related
expenses
and
debt
consolidation.
On
the
other
hand,
banks
often
restrict
the
use
of
personal
loan
funds
on
post
secondary
education
costs,
business
purposes
and
illegal
activities.
&nbsp;
While
most
lenders
ask
prospective
borrowers
to
provide
the
purpose
of
the
loan
in
their
application,
some
banks
are
more
strict—requiring
borrowers
to
use
the
loan
on
exactly
what
they
identify
in
the
initial
loan
application.

To
help
support
our
reporting
work,
and
to
continue
our
ability
to
provide
this
content
for
free
to
our
readers,
we
receive
compensation
from
the
companies
that
advertise
on
the
Forbes
Advisor
site.
This
compensation
comes
from
two
main
sources.
First
,
we
provide
paid
placements
to
advertisers
to
present
their
offers.
The
compensation
we
receive
for
those
placements
affects
how
and
where
advertisers’
offers
appear
on
the
site.
This
site
does
not
include
all
companies
or
products
available
within
the
market.
Second,
we
also
include
links
to
advertisers’
offers
in
some
of
our
articles;
these
“affiliate
links”
may
generate
income
for
our
site
when
you
click
on
them.
The
compensation
we
receive
from
advertisers
does
not
influence
the
recommendations
or
advice
our
editorial
team
provides
in
our
articles
or
otherwise
impact
any
of
the
editorial
content
on
Forbes
Advisor.
While
we
work
hard
to
provide
accurate
and
up
to
date
information
that
we
think
you
will
find
relevant,
Forbes
Advisor
does
not
and
cannot
guarantee
that
any
information
provided
is
complete
and
makes
no
representations
or
warranties
in
connection
thereto,
nor
to
the
accuracy
or
applicability
thereof.
Here
is
a
list
of
our
partners
who
offer
products
that
we
have
affiliate
links
for.
