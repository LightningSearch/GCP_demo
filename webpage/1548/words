What
is
Big
Data?
“Big
Data”
is
one
of
the
commonly
used
buzz
words
of
our
current
era,
but
what
does
it
really
mean?
Here’s
a
quick,
simple
definition
of
big
data.
Big
data
is
data
that
is
too
large
and
complex
to
be
handled
by
traditional
data
processing
and
storage
methods.
While
that’s
a
quick
definition
you
can
use
as
a
heuristic,
it
would
be
helpful
to
have
a
deeper,
more
complete
understanding
of
big
data.
Let’s
take
a
look
at
some
of
the
concepts
that
underlie
big
data,
like
storage,
structure,
and
processing.
How
Big
Is
Big
Data?
It
isn’t
as
simple
as
saying
“any
data
over
the
size
‘X
‘is
big
data”,
the
environment
that
the
data
is
being
handled
in
is
an
extremely
important
factor
in
determining
what
qualifies
as
big
data
.
The
size
that
data
needs
to
be,
in
order
to
be
considered
big
data,
is
dependant
upon
the
context,
or
the
task
the
data
is
being
used
in.
Two
datasets
of
vastly
different
sizes
can
be
considered
“big
data”
in
different
contexts.
To
be
more
concrete,
if
you
try
to
send
a
200-megabyte
file
as
an
email
attachment,
you
would
not
be
able
to
do
so.
In
this
context,
the
200-megabyte
file
could
be
considered
big
data.
In
contrast,
copying
a
200-megabyte
file
to
another
device
within
the
same
LAN
may
not
take
any
time
at
all,
and
in
that
context,
it
wouldn’t
be
regarded
as
big
data.
However,
let’s
assume
that
15
terabytes
worth
of
video
need
to
be
pre-processed
for
use
in
training
computer
vision
applications.
In
this
case,
the
video
files
take
up
so
much
space
that
even
a
powerful
computer
would
take
a
long
time
to
process
them
all,
and
so
the
processing
would
normally
be
distributed
across
multiple
computers
linked
together
in
order
to
decrease
processing
time.
These
15
terabytes
of
video
data
would
definitely
qualify
as
big
data.
Types
Of
Big
Data
Structures
Big
data
comes
in
three
different
categories
of
structure:
un-structured
data,
semi-structured,
and
structured
data.
Unstructured
data
is
data
that
possesses
no
definable
structure,
meaning
the
data
is
essentially
just
in
one
large
pool.
Examples
of
unstructured
data
would
be
a
database
full
of
unlabeled
images.
Semi-structured
data
is
data
that
doesn’t
have
a
formal
structure,
but
does
exist
within
a
loose
structure.
For
example,
email
data
might
count
as
semi-structured
data,
because
you
could
refer
to
the
data
contained
in
individual
emails,
but
formal
data
patterns
have
not
been
established.
Structured
data
is
data
that
has
a
formal
structure,
with
data
points
categorized
by
different
features.
One
example
of
structured
data
is
an
excel
spreadsheet
containing
contact
information
like
names,
emails,
phone
numbers,
and
websites.

you

more

the
differences
in
these
data
types,

Metrics
For
Assessing
Big
Data
Big
data
can
be
analyzed
in
terms
of
three
different
metrics
:
volume,
velocity,
and
variety.
Volume
refers
to
the
size
of
the
data.
The
average
size
of
datasets
is
often
increasing.
For
example,
the
largest
hard
drive
in
2006
was
a
750
GB
hard
drive.
In
contrast,
Facebook
is
thought
to
generate
over
500
terabytes
of
data
in
a
day
and
the
largest
consumer
hard
drive
available
today
is
a
16
terabyte
hard
drive.
What
quantifies
as
big
data
in
one
era
may
not
be
big
data
in
another.
More
data
is
generated
today
because
more
and
more
of
the
objects
surrounding
us
are
equipped
with
sensors,
cameras,
microphones,
and
other
data
collection
devices.
Velocity
refers
to
how
fast
data
is
moving,
or
to
put
that
another
way,
how
much
data
is
generated
within
a
given
period
of
time.
Social
media
streams
generate
hundreds
of
thousands
of
posts
and
comments
every
minute,
while
your
own
email
inbox
will
probably
have
much
less
activity.
Big
data
streams
are
streams
that
often
handle
hundreds
of
thousands
or
millions
of
events
in
more
or
less
real-time.
Examples
of
these
data
streams
are
online
gaming
platforms
and
high-frequency
stock
trading
algorithms.
Variety
refers
to
the
different
types
of
data
contained
within
the
dataset.
Data
can
be
made
up
of
many
different
formats,
like
audio,
video,
text,
photos,
or
serial
numbers.
In
general,
traditional
databases
are
formatted
to
handle
one,
or
just
a
couple,
types
of
data.
To
put
that
another
way,
traditional
databases
are
structured
to
hold
data
that
is
fairly
homogeneous
and
of
a
consistent,
predictable
structure.
As
applications
become
more
diverse,
full
of
different
features,
and
used
by
more
people,
databases
have
had
to
evolve
to
store
more
types
of
data.
Unstructured
databases
are
ideal
for
holding
big
data,
as
they
can
hold
multiple
data
types
that
aren’t
related
to
each
other.
Methods
Of
Handling
Big
Data
There
are
a
number
of
different
platforms
and
tools
designed
to
facilitate
the
analysis
of
big
data.
Big
data
pools
need
to
be
analyzed
to
extract
meaningful
patterns
from
the
data,
a
task
that
can
prove
quite
challenging
with
traditional
data
analysis
tools.
In
response
to
the
need
for
tools
to
analyze
large
volumes
of
data,
a
variety
of
companies
have
created
big
data
analysis
tools.
Big
data
analysis
tools
include
systems
like
ZOHO
Analytics,
Cloudera,
and
Microsoft
BI.
