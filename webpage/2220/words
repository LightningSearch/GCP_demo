The
Pandemic
Has
Changed
The
Game
For
Learning
And
Primed
Education
For
Continued
Disruption
When
it
comes
to
education,
we
can’t
afford
gaps
in
learning
and
particularly
during
a
pandemic,
students
risk
falling
behind.
It’s
not
as
simple
as
flipping
to
virtual
learning
we
need
the
tools
to
support
and
empower
teachers
and
learners
while
creating
continuous
educational
improvements.
