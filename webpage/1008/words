The
Future
of
AI
in
Banking
(2019)
Banks
have
long
been
on
the
cutting
edge
of
technological
advancements.
From
computers
to
the
internet
to
mobile
apps,
few
industries
have
benefited
as
much
from
new
technology
as
the
banking
industry.
Artificial
intelligence
(AI)
is
no
different.
With
the
rise
of
AI,
banks
have
a
new
tool
to
handle
any
number
of
tasks
that
are
traditionally
time-consuming,
labor
intensive,
and
prone
to
mistakes.
There
are
several
ways
AI
is
doing
this
and
will
continue
to
do
so
in
the
years
ahead.
Document
Review
JPMorgan
Chase
made
headlines
with
its
deployment
of
an
AI
bot
whose
function
was
quite
different
from
those
of
other
banks.
Whereas
many
banks
are
using
AI
in
the
form
of
chatbots
that
interact
with
customers,
JPMorgan
Chase
deployed
a
bot,
known
as
COIN,
that
customers
will
never
see—a
bot
that
analyzes
contracts,
agreements,
paperwork,
and
legal
documents.
COIN
is
so
successful
that
in
the
first
15
months
of
deployment,
the
AI
saved
the
bank
some
360,000
hours
of
manpower.
COIN
can
do
in
seconds
what
takes
human
beings
hours
to
accomplish.
Just
as
important,
COIN
can
analyze
complex
agreements,
contracts,
and
legal
documents
more
accurately
than
a
person.
Anti-Money
Laundering
Anti-money
laundering
(AML)
is
another
area
where
banks
are
beginning
to
tap
into
the
power
of
AI.
Detecting
money
laundering
is
a
notoriously
difficult
task.
With
hundreds
of
thousands
of
wire
transfers
totaling
trillions
of
dollars
a
day—not
to
mention
the
various
privacy
laws
designed
to
protect
financial
customers—it’s
almost
impossible
to
identify
every
instance
of
money
laundering.
In
spite
of
that,
in
the
aftermath
of
9/11,
banks
are
required
to
do
everything
possible
to
identify
and
help
combat
money
laundering.
While
banks
have
been
using
rule-based
software
to
identify
money
laundering
for
some
time,
AI
offers
a
significant
improvement.
True
AI
learns,
grows,
and
adapts
with
each
experience,
both
successful
and
unsuccessful.
As
a
result,
while
AI
is
already
making
a
dent
in
AML,
as
time
goes
on,
it
will
continue
to
rack
up
successes.
Much
of
this
is
due
to
AI’s
ability
to
process
large
quantities
of
data
and
see
trends
and
patterns
that
can
be
easily
missed
when
attempting
to
detect
money
laundering.
Fraud
Detection
Closely
related
is
the
use
of
AI
in
fraud
detection.
Virtually
every
credit
card
and
debit
card
user
has
been
on
the
receiving
end
of
having
their
suspended
due
to
suspicious
activity.
Unfortunately,
more
often
than
not,
there’s
no
actual
fraudulent
activity.
Traveling,
using
a
card
at
unfamiliar
stores
or
purchasing
products
from
some
online
stores
can
trigger
a
fraudulent
warning.
Another
area
where
AI
is
beginning
to
shines
is
improved
customer
experience.
Thanks
to
machine
learning,
AI
can
identify
patterns
and
data
points
that
rudimentary,
rule-based
software
can
easily
miss.
Also,
AI
offers
improved
privacy
and
security—an
essential
factor
when
discussing
financial
transactions.
Predictive
Banking
For
centuries
banks
have
responded
to
customer
needs
after
being
approached
by
a
customer
making
a
request.
For
the
first
time
in
history,
banks
can
anticipate
what
customers
want
and
need
before
being
contacted,
 and
instead
approach
the
customer
to
meet
those
needs.
AI
is
making
that
possible
for
the
first
time
in
history.
AI
uses
vast
quantities
of
data;
it
has
access
to
create
predictive
profiles
of
customers.
Banks
now
can
offer
services
to
customers
based
on
real-time
data
and
insights.
Instead
of
waiting
for
a
customer
to
approach
the
bank
with
a
request,
virtual
agents
can
analyze
data
and
propose
a
service,
or
mix
of
services,
tailored
to
the
customer’s
needs.
In
time,
it’s
entirely
likely
that
virtual
agents
will
eventually
begin
replacing
many
traditional
roles
in
the
banking
industry.
AI
offers
the
ability
for
banks
to
make
data-based
decisions
faster,
in
real-time
and
proactively.
As
with
any
use
of
true
AI,
the
more
transactions
a
virtual
agent
engages
in,
the
better,
more
efficient
it
will
become.
Customer
Service
AI
is
already
revolutionizing
the
customer
service
process.
It’s
no
secret
that
banks
have
different
tiers
of
support.
Unfortunately,
like
any
business,
banks
have
limited
resources
and
cannot
afford
to
provide
everyone
with
that
level
of
service—until
now.
AI
provides
a
viable
way
for
all
of
a
bank’s
customers
to
receive
top-notch
service.
Chatbots
offer
24/7
help
and
support,
mobile
banking
apps
use
predictive
algorithms
to
show
customers
what
they
want
to
see
preemptively
and
virtual
loan
officers
and
financial
advisors
can
proactively
make
offers
and
provide
financial
advice—all
based
on
data
and
machine
learning
AI.
Meanwhile,
on
the
back-end,
AI
can
be
double-checking
and
analyzing
legal
documents
and
contracts
to
ensure
the
customer,
as
well
as
the
bank,
are
protected.
AI-Based
Banking:
The
Future
The
evidence
is
clear:
The
future
of
AI
in
banking
in
2019
and
beyond
has
never
looked
better.
In
fact,
in
an
article
for
Global
Banking
&amp;
Finance
Review
,
Five
Degrees
CEO
Martijn
Hohmann
predicts
that
“through
using
cognitive
computing
systems,
including
real-time
insights
and
information
processing,
banks
can
seize
an
opportunity
that
will
grow
revenues
up
to
30
percent
by
2022.”
Whether
it
document
processing,
anti-money
laundering,
fraud
detection,
predictive
banking,
or
customer
service,
AI
offers
a
level
of
efficiency
that
is
unparalleled
in
the
history
of
banking.
With
access
to
virtually
unlimited
data,
AI
can
see
trends,
patterns,
outliers,
and
data
points
in
a
much
larger
context
than
the
average
human
could
easily
discern.
Best
of
all,
with
an
increasing
focus
on
privacy,
AI
represents
a
viable
way
to
use
that
data
in
a
safe,
responsible
manner.
