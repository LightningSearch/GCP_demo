Commitments
totalling
more
than
$200
million
will
help
StreetShares
focus
on
its
mission
to
provide
loans
to
veteran-owned
small
businesses.
Community
Investment
Management
(CIM),
Direct
Lending
Investments,
and
Eagle
Bank
Corp
will
team
up
to
fund
$200
million
in
small
business
loans
over
the
next
four
years.
Talking
about
his
company&#8217;s
determination
to
&#8220;put
money
to
work
fueling
healthy
small
businesses,&#8221;
Direct
Lending
Investments
president
Brendan
Ross
said
that
&#8220;marketplace
lending
is
exploding.
We
are
excited
about
this
business
partnership
with
StreetShares
and
the
unique
business
owners
they
serve.&#8221;
Jacob
Haar,
CIM
managing
partner,
praised
StreetShares&#8217;
&#8220;responsible
and
transparent
financing
to
underserved
small
businesses,&#8221;
and
added
that
the
company&#8217;s
approach
to
lending
to
veteran-owned
small
businesses
would
be
a
positive
&#8220;long-term
value
for
borrowers,
local
communities,
and
investors.&#8221;
StreetShares
is
a
peer-to-peer,
affinity-based,
social
lending
marketplace
that
matches
accredited
investors
with
eligible
small
business
borrowers.
Businesses
can
apply
for
loans
online
or
by
phone
and
get
preapproved
within
24
hours.
Companies
then
provide
verification
documents
and
prepare
a
&#8220;business
pitch&#8221;
StreetShares
calls
&#8220;your
storefront
on
the
StreetShares
marketplace.&#8221;
Investors
on
the
platform
will
rely
on
the
company&#8217;s
&#8220;business
pitch&#8221;
in
order
to
decide
whether
to
bid
on
the
company&#8217;s
loan.
Competing
investors
&#8220;win&#8221;
the
right
to
fund
the
loan
by
providing
the
lowest
interest
rate.
Applying
businesses
must
be
revenue-positive
and
in
operation
for
at
least
one
year.
Loan
terms
are
one
and
three
years
for
amounts
up
to
$50,000.
There
are
no
application
fees
or
prepayment
penalties,
and
funded
businesses
pay
a
one-time
origination
fee
between
1.45%
and
4.95%.
Repayment
is
managed
via
a
fixed
weekly
deduction
from
the
company&#8217;s
verified
bank
account.
Investors
on
the
platform
must
be
&#8220;accredited&#8221;—meaning
individual
income
of
$200,000
or
more
($300,000
with
spouse)
or
a
net
worth
of
at
least
$1,000,000,
excluding
value
of
primary
residence.
According
to
the
company,
the
majority
of
its
borrowers
are
small
businesses
owned
by
U.S.
veterans.
Via
the
platform,
StreetShares
considers
itself
the
biggest
coalition
of
veteran-based
small
businesses
and
service
providers
in
the
country.
Mark
L.
Rockefeller,
StreetShares
CEO
who
co-founded
the
company
with
Mickey
Konson,
is
himself
an
Iraqi
War
veteran.
StreetShares
made
its
Finovate
debut
at
FinovateEurope
2015
in
London
this
February.
