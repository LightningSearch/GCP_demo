If
there
is
a
title
to
be
contested
in
the
automotive
cosmos,
full-size
pickup
trucks
compete
in
the
heavyweight
class.
Imposing
in
size
and
sales
volume,
trucks
make
headlines
and
generate
profits
capable
of
turning
entire
corporate
ledger
sheets
from
red
to
black.
With
the
stakes
that
high,
manufactures
are
in
a
constant
state
of
reinvention,
in
a
perpetual
battle
for
showroom
supremacy.
The
consumer
is
the
real
winner.
Initially
tailored
for
commercial
and
agricultural
customers,
pickups
have
long
transcended
their
bare-bones
birthright.
No
demographic
is
ignored:
there
are
gasoline,
diesel
and
hybrid
powertrains
(EV
trucks
are
on
the
way),
countless
cab
and
bed
configurations,
cabins
outfitted
with
modern
tech
and
luxury
appointments
that
rival
premium
car
brands.
The
one
thing
that’s
kept
pace
with
their
growing
popularity
is
their
cost.
While
spartan
work
trucks
still
exist,
the
number
of
trims,
special
packages
and
optional
features
make
one
trip
through
the
order
sheet
relatively
easy
to
crest
the
$70,000-mark.
Still,
buyers
don’t
seem
to
mind
pickups
that
cost
more
than
a
(state)
college
education.
Perhaps
it’s
true
that
if
you
build
it,
they
will
come.
The
nominees
and
winners
were
selected
by
the
2020
Forbes
Wheels
Car
of
the
Year
panel,
comprising
four
staff
editors
and
seven
contributors.
Our
criteria
included
performance,
safety,
technology,
comfort
and
convenience,
fuel
economy,
design
and
functionality.
Because
each
category
spans
the
full
spectrum
of
pricing,
we
selected
vehicles
that
stand
out
among
their
peers.
Vehicles
eligible
for
nomination
include
any
car
or
truck
for
sale
or
in
production
during
2020;
some
debuted
prior
to
2020.

Why
We
Picked
It
General
Motors’
Chevrolet
brand
trailed
cross-town
rival
Ford
into
the
truck
business
by
just
a
single
year
and
the
two
have
been
duking
it
out
ever
since.
The
1960
arrival
of
the
C/K
line
turned
up
the
fire,
and
was
renamed
Silverado
in
1999.
Chevrolet
“only”
sold
about
575,000
Silverados
in
2019,
but
adding
the
232,000
sales
of
the
closely-related
GMC
Sierra,
GM
is
nipping
at
Ford’s
heels.
In
its
fourth
generation,
Silverado
takes
a
traditional
approach
with
a
proven
leaf-spring
suspension
and
steel
body.
Unique
to
the
segment,
it
offers
a
turbocharged
2.7-liter
four-cylinder
engine
with
310
horsepower
and
348
pound-feet
of
torque.
The
new
four
out-muscles
the
older
4.3-liter
V6
by
25
ponies
and
43
pound-feet.
Both
have
their
merits,
but
where
the
Silverado
shines
is
in
the
mid-level
LT
Trail
Boss
trim
with
Z51
off-road
package
and
the
new
for
2020
3.0-liter
inline
six-cylinder
diesel.
It’s
quiet—for
a
diesel—clean
and
returns
an
EPA-estimated
22
and
29
mpg
in
four-wheel
drive
versions.
Still,
while
the
Silverado’s
capability
has
never
been
in
question,
its
tech
interfaces
and
graphics
feel
a
little
behind
the
pack.
Plus,
while
the
competition
has
gone
subtly
upscale
with
grille
and
fascia
designs,
the
Silverado’s
aggressive
styling
hasn’t
been
universally
loved.

Why
We
Picked
It
While
the
F-Series
nomenclature
didn’t
arrive
until
1948,
the
Ford
pickup
story
dates
to
1917
and
the
million-selling
Model
TT
truck.
From
those
humble
beginnings
emerged
a
juggernaut:
the
Ford
F-Series
trucks
(including
the
F-250
and
larger
Super
Duty
models),
which
has
claimed
the
top-selling
truck
spot
for
43
years
and
the
best-selling
vehicle
title
for
over
a
decade.
More
than
890,000
F-Series
trucks
were
sold
in
2019.
In
its
fourteenth
generation,
the
new
for
2021
Ford
F-150
builds
on
all
the
breakthroughs
of
the
last
decade,
including
aluminum
bodywork,
turbocharged
engines
and
advanced
towing
tech.
It
also
brings
a
more
aerodynamic
and
stately
exterior,
a
thoughtful
interior
with
a
12-inch
touchscreen
and
an
innovative
hybrid
powertrain
that
doubles
as
an
onsite
generator.
Dubbed

the

up
to
7,200
watts
of
A/C
power,
enough
for
numerous
tools
or
23
refrigerators,
as
Ford
claims.
With

Why
We
Picked
It
Honda
built
its
reputation
by
entering
established
segments—motorcycles,
automobiles,
power
equipment
and
even
aircraft—and
then
bending
the
rules
to
fit
its
own
agenda.
The
Ridgeline
pickup
is
no
exception.
Introduced
for
the
2006
model
year,
its
unibody
construction
and
front-wheel
drive
layout
polarized
truck
pundits
upon
launch.
Relaunched
for
the
2017
model
year
after
brief
hiatus,
the
second-generation
Ridgeline
ditched
its
original
transformer
look
for
more
traditional
styling.
A
mild
cosmetic
refresh
for
2021
brought
a
more
truck-like
face
in
an
attempt
to
appeal
to
buyers
still
on
the
fence.
Still,
the
Ridgeline
has
never
made
a
serious
play
to
topple
the
sales
of
conventional
body-on-frame
mid-
and
full-size
trucks.
Instead,
it
blends
a
car-like
ride,
competent
handling
and
SUV
height
with
a
bed
in
the
back.
If
the
Ridgeline’s
appeal
is
still
baffling,
think
of
it
as
80%
of
the
truck
70%
of
buyers
will
ever
need.
Part
of
its
appeal
is
that
it
asks
nothing
from
buyers
for
its
added
utility.
The
interior,
including
the
rear
seating
area,
is
spacious
and
the
ride
quality
and
handling
from
the
four-wheel
independent
suspension
is
compliant
and
comparatively
sharp.
It’s
280-horsepower
3.5-liter
V6
engine
that
makes
262
pound-feet
of
torque
and
nine-speed
automatic
transmission
have
Honda’s
trademark
“ready
to
rev”
personality
baked
in.
Leave
the
tailgate
down,
and
it’ll
fit
the
vaunted
4×8
size
sheet
goods;
but
with
a
max
tow
rating
of
5,000
pounds,
it’s
best
suited
to
small
trailers
for
jet
skis
and
the
like.

Honda
built
its
reputation
by
entering
established
segments—motorcycles,
automobiles,
power
equipment
and
even
aircraft—and
then
bending
the
rules
to
fit
its
own
agenda.
The
Ridgeline
pickup
is
no
exception.
Introduced
for
the
2006
model
year,
its
unibody
construction
and
front-wheel
drive
layout
polarized
truck
pundits
upon
launch.
Relaunched
for
the
2017
model
year
after
brief
hiatus,
the
second-generation
Ridgeline
ditched
its
original
transformer
look
for
more
traditional
styling.
A
mild
cosmetic
refresh
for
2021
brought
a
more
truck-like
face
in
an
attempt
to
appeal
to
buyers
still
on
the
fence.
Still,
the
Ridgeline
has
never
made
a
serious
play
to
topple
the
sales
of
conventional
body-on-frame
mid-
and
full-size
trucks.
Instead,
it
blends
a
car-like
ride,
competent
handling
and
SUV
height
with
a
bed
in
the
back.
If
the
Ridgeline’s
appeal
is
still
baffling,
think
of
it
as
80%
of
the
truck
70%
of
buyers
will
ever
need.
Part
of
its
appeal
is
that
it
asks
nothing
from
buyers
for
its
added
utility.
The
interior,
including
the
rear
seating
area,
is
spacious
and
the
ride
quality
and
handling
from
the
four-wheel
independent
suspension
is
compliant
and
comparatively
sharp.
It’s
280-horsepower
3.5-liter
V6
engine
that
makes
262
pound-feet
of
torque
and
nine-speed
automatic
transmission
have
Honda’s
trademark
“ready
to
rev”
personality
baked
in.
Leave
the
tailgate
down,
and
it’ll
fit
the
vaunted
4×8
size
sheet
goods;
but
with
a
max
tow
rating
of
5,000
pounds,
it’s
best
suited
to
small
trailers
for
jet
skis
and
the
like.

Why
We
Picked
It
The
first
genuine
Jeep
pickup
since
the
XJ-based
Jeep
Comanche
disappeared
in
1992,
the
current
Gladiator
borrows
its
name
from
the
J-Series
Gladiator
that
ended
production
in
1987.
Jeep
fans—and
about
anyone
else
with
even
a
passing
interest
in
off-roading—have
for
years
been
saying
“Jeep
should
make
Wrangler
pickup.”
For
the
2020
model
year,
it
did.
Based
on
the
Wrangler,
the
Gladiator
shares
that
model’s
iconic
looks
and
the
same
casual-cool
but
capable
message
to
both
the
passengers
and
bystanders.
The
longer
wheelbase—137.3-inches
for
the
Gladiator
and
118.4
inches
for
the
Wrangler
four-door—smooths
out
the
on-road
ride
and
the
interior
is
nearly
identical.
It’s
the
bed
that
makes
all
the
difference,
adding
a
dash
of
utility
compared
with
Wrangler’s
cramped
cargo
area.
For
2021,
a
3.0-liter
turbocharged
diesel
V6
joined
Fiat
Chrysler’s
3.9-liter
Pentastar
V6
engine.
The
diesel’s
torquey
low-end
demeanor
is
tailor-made
for
Gladiator.
While
it’s
7,650-pound
hauling
capacity
doesn’t
compete
with
the
ever-escalating
11,000-pound
(and
up)
tow
ratings
of
full-size
pickups,
removing
the
roof
and
heading
for
the
beach
on
a
sunny
day
in
the
Gladiator
is
a
consolation
prize.
Pros

Why
We
Picked
It
Ram
Truck
was
spun
off
into
a
single
division
in
2010
shortly
after
Chrysler
emerged
from
bankruptcy
in
2009,
but
using
the
name
“Ram”
to
signify
specific
Dodge
truck
models
dates
to
1980.
Since
the
spin-off,
Ram’s
been
on
a
non-stop
quest
to
dethrone
Ford
and
Chevy.
It’s
had
some
success.
Collectively,
2019
sales
of
the
Ram
1500,
2500
HD
and
3500
HD
topped
630,000
units
in
2019,
up
18%
from
the
previous
year.
A
perennial
underdog,
in
2010,
Ram
made
the
bold
decision
to
replace
traditional
rear
leaf
springs
for
coil
springs
and
won
a
whole
new
legion
of
fans
based
on
the
smooth
ride
they
provide.
Revised
significantly
for
2019,
the
current
fifth-generation
2021
Ram
1500
continues
to
deliver
arguably
the
best
ride
in
the
segment.
Coupled
with
a
quiet
cabin
with
upgraded
material
quality,
FCA’s
intuitive
Uconnect
5
infotainment
system
with
a
12.3-inch
touchscreen,
it’s
a
pleasant
place
to
spend
time.
There’s
also
the
mild-hybrid
Etorque
option
that
adds
130
pound-feet
of
torque
right
off
idle
using
a
belt-driven
generator
as
well
as
the
3.0-liter
diesel
V6.
Although
older
and
noisier
than
the
state-of-the-art
inline
six-cylinder
diesel
in
the
Silverado,
it
still
manages
22
mpg
in

and
32
