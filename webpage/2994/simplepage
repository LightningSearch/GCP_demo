Imposing in size and sales volume, trucks make headlines and generate profits capable of turning entire corporate ledger sheets from red to black. With the stakes that high, manufactures are in a constant state of reinvention, in a perpetual battle for showroom supremacy. The consumer is the real winner. Initially tailored for commercial and agricultural customers, pickups have long transcended their bare-bones birthright. No demographic is ignored: there are gasoline, diesel and hybrid powertrains (EV trucks are on the way), countless cab and bed configurations, cabins outfitted with modern tech and luxury appointments that rival premium car brands. The one thing that’s kept pace with their growing popularity is their cost. While spartan work trucks still exist, the number of trims, special packages and optional features make one trip through the order sheet relatively easy to crest the $70,000-mark. Still, buyers don’t seem to mind pickups that cost more than a (state) college education. Perhaps it’s true that if you build it, they will come. The nominees and winners were selected by the 2020 Forbes Wheels Car of the Year panel, comprising four staff editors and seven contributors. Our criteria included performance, safety, technology, comfort and convenience, fuel economy, design and functionality. Because each category spans the full spectrum of pricing, we selected vehicles that stand out among their peers. Vehicles eligible for nomination include any car or truck for sale or in production during 2020; some debuted prior to 2020.

The Ridgeline pickup is no exception. Introduced for the 2006 model year, its unibody construction and front-wheel drive layout polarized truck pundits upon launch. Relaunched for the 2017 model year after brief hiatus, the second-generation Ridgeline ditched its original transformer look for more traditional styling. A mild cosmetic refresh for 2021 brought a more truck-like face in an attempt to appeal to buyers still on the fence. Still, the Ridgeline has never made a serious play to topple the sales of conventional body-on-frame mid- and full-size trucks. Instead, it blends a car-like ride, competent handling and SUV height with a bed in the back. If the Ridgeline’s appeal is still baffling, think of it as 80% of the truck 70% of buyers will ever need. Part of its appeal is that it asks nothing from buyers for its added utility. The interior, including the rear seating area, is spacious and the ride quality and handling from the four-wheel independent suspension is compliant and comparatively sharp.

Jeep fans—and about anyone else with even a passing interest in off-roading—have for years been saying “Jeep should make Wrangler pickup.” For the 2020 model year, it did. Based on the Wrangler, the Gladiator shares that model’s iconic looks and the same casual-cool but capable message to both the passengers and bystanders. The longer wheelbase—137.3-inches for the Gladiator and 118.4 inches for the Wrangler four-door—smooths out the on-road ride and the interior is nearly identical. It’s the bed that makes all the difference, adding a dash of utility compared with Wrangler’s cramped cargo area. For 2021, a 3.0-liter turbocharged diesel V6 joined Fiat Chrysler’s 3.9-liter Pentastar V6 engine. The diesel’s torquey low-end demeanor is tailor-made for Gladiator. While it’s 7,650-pound hauling capacity doesn’t compete with the ever-escalating 11,000-pound (and up) tow ratings of full-size pickups, removing the roof and heading for the beach on a sunny day in the Gladiator is a consolation prize.

Since the spin-off, Ram’s been on a non-stop quest to dethrone Ford and Chevy. It’s had some success. Collectively, 2019 sales of the Ram 1500, 2500 HD and 3500 HD topped 630,000 units in 2019, up 18% from the previous year. A perennial underdog, in 2010, Ram made the bold decision to replace traditional rear leaf springs for coil springs and won a whole new legion of fans based on the smooth ride they provide. Revised significantly for 2019, the current fifth-generation 2021 Ram 1500 continues to deliver arguably the best ride in the segment. Coupled with a quiet cabin with upgraded material quality, FCA’s intuitive Uconnect 5 infotainment system with a 12.3-inch touchscreen, it’s a pleasant place to spend time. There’s also the mild-hybrid Etorque option that adds 130 pound-feet of torque right off idle using a belt-driven generator as well as the 3.0-liter diesel V6.
