This is why it happened. The stock price of Nio Inc (NYSE: NIO) has increased by 22.97% over the past week as it went from $37 per share on March 8 morning to a closing price of $45.50 yesterday. There were a few catalysts that led to the stock price increase. Norway&#8217;s Central Bank Buys Stake According to a Barron&#8217;s report , the central bank of Norway bought a stake in Nio. Specifically, Norges Bank bought 13.4 million NIO American depositary receipts in the fourth quarter. This raised the bank&#8217;s stake to 13.7 million ADRs of Nio. Analyst Rating Analysts at Mizuho recently published a bullish report about Nio. Mizuho&#8217;s Vijay Rakesh set a price target of $60 on Nio and said that the company is a leader and innovator in the premium automotive electric vehicle segment. Plus Rakesh noted that Nio is based in China, which gives the electric vehicle company a home court advantage. &#8220;With a small 0.1% share of overall global light vehicle production, we believe NIO has significant upside as it expands in China, into Europe in 2H21E, and potentially into other markets,&#8221; wrote Rakesh in the report. A subsidy in China and a battery-as-a-service program also makes Nio&#8217;s vehicles more affordable against competing brands such as Tesla.
