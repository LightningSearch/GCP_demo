This
Past
Week:
Why
It
Happened
The
stock
price
of
Nio
Inc
(NYSE:
NIO)
has
increased
by
22.97%
over
the
past
week.
This
is
why
it
happened.
The
stock
price
of
Nio
Inc
(NYSE:
NIO)
has
increased
by
22.97%
over
the
past
week
as
it
went
from
$37
per
share
on
March
8
morning
to
a
closing
price
of
$45.50
yesterday.
There
were
a
few
catalysts
that
led
to
the
stock
price
increase.
Norway&#8217;s
Central
Bank
Buys
Stake
According
to
a
Barron&#8217;s
report
,
the
central
bank
of
Norway
bought
a
stake
in
Nio.
Specifically,
Norges
Bank
bought
13.4
million
NIO
American
depositary
receipts
in
the
fourth
quarter.
This
raised
the
bank&#8217;s
stake
to
13.7
million
ADRs
of
Nio.
Analyst
Rating
Analysts
at
Mizuho
recently
published
a
bullish
report
about
Nio.
Mizuho&#8217;s
Vijay
Rakesh
set
a
price
target
of
$60
on
Nio
and
said
that
the
company
is
a
leader
and
innovator
in
the
premium
automotive
electric
vehicle
segment.
Plus
Rakesh
noted
that
Nio
is
based
in
China,
which
gives
the
electric
vehicle
company
a
home
court
advantage.
&#8220;With
a
small
0.1%
share
of
overall
global
light
vehicle
production,
we
believe
NIO
has
significant
upside
as
it
expands
in
China,
into
Europe
in
2H21E,
and
potentially
into
other
markets,&#8221;
wrote
Rakesh
in
the
report.
A
subsidy
in
China
and
a
battery-as-a-service
program
also
makes
Nio&#8217;s
vehicles
more
affordable
against
competing
brands
such
as
Tesla.
