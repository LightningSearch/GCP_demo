Mark
Hirschhorn,
the
current
president,
COO
and
CFO
of
Talkspace,
has
been
named
to
the
board
of
Livonia-based
digital
health
company
Hygieia.
Hirschhorn
will
bring
his
experience
from
Talkspace
and
Teladoc,
both
telehealth
companies,
where
he
led
the
company’s
growth
strategy.
Teladoc
grew
from
$10
million
in
revenue
with
45
employees
to
$500
million
and
2,500
employees
under
Hirschhorn.
The
announcement
comes
as
Hygieia
accelerates
it
growth
initiatives
following
increasing
demand
for
its
health
app
d-Nav,
the
only
FDA-cleared
technology
that
automates
dose
adjustments
for
patients
who
inject
insulin.
d-NAV
has
created
an
automated
route
for
safe
and
effective
insulin
treatment
that
has
nearly
90
percent
of
patients
seeing
improved
A1c
levels
within
90
days.
“Today’s
health
care
environment
desperately
needs
medical
technology
solutions
like
d-Nav,
which
automate
tasks
and
operate
remotely,”
says
Hirschhorn.
“I’m
excited
to
join
Hygieia’s
board
as
the
company
begins
to
experience
significant
growth,
and
I’m
looking
forward
to
helping
them
drive
better
care
for
people
with
type
2
diabetes.”
Eran
Bashan,
CEO
and
co-founder
of
Hygieia,
says
the
company
is
preparing
for
growth
due
to
the
need
for
change
to
the
standard
of
insulin
therapy.
Bashan
says
it
is
important
to
have
technology
that
can
automate
dosing
based
on
real-time
individual
need.
“Mark
joins
our
board
during
a
time
of
unprecedented
company
growth
and
in
a
market
that
is
uniquely
primed
for
innovation,”
says
Bashan.
“Mark
has
the
perfect
combination
of
expertise
in
the
digital
health
industry
and
will
help
us
navigate
this
transitional
period.”
The
d-Nav
Insulin
Management
Program
was
developed
by
two
University
of
Michigan
researchers
and
has
been
published
in
leading
medical
journals. Physicians
A.
Mark
Fendrick
and
George
Grunberger
have
also
recently
joined
the
advisory
board.
