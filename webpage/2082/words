Yasser
Khan, 
is
the
CEO
of
ONE
Tech
an
AI-driven
technology
company
that
designs,
develops
and
deploys
next-generation
IoT
solutions
for
OEMs,
network
operators
and
enterprises.
What
initially
attracted
you
to
Artificial
Intelligence?
A
few
years
ago,
we
deployed
an
Industrial
Internet
of
Things
(IIoT)
solution
that
connected
many
assets
across
a
wide
geographic
location.
The
amount
of
data
that
was
generated
was
immense.
We
aggregated
data
from
PLCs
at
sampling
rates
of
50
milliseconds
and
external
sensor
values
a
few
times
a
second.
Over
the
course
of
a
single
minute,
we
had
thousands
of
datapoints
being
generated
for
each
asset
we
were
connecting
to.
We
knew
that
the
standard
method
of
transmitting
this
data
to
a
server
and
having
a
person
evaluate
the
data
was
not
realistic,
nor
beneficial
for
the
business.
So
we
set
out
to
create
a
product
that
would
process
the
data
and
generate
consumable
outputs,
greatly
reducing
the
amount
of
oversight
that
an
organization
needs
in
order
to
reap
the
benefits
of
a
digital
transformation
deployment—heavily
focused
on
asset
performance
management
and
predictive
maintenance.
Can
you
discuss
what
ONE
Tech’s
MicroAI
solution
is?
 
MicroAI™
is
a
Machine
Learning
platform
that
provides
a
greater
level
of
insight
into
asset
(device
or
machine)
performance,
utilization
and
overall
behavior.
This
benefit
ranges
from
manufacturing
plant
managers
who
are
looking
for
ways
to
improve
overall
equipment
effectiveness
to
hardware
OEMs
who
want
to
better
understand
how
their
devices
are
preforming
out
in
the
field.
We
accomplish
this
by
deploying
a
small
(as
small
as
70kb)
packet
onto
the
microcontroller
(MCU)
or
microprocessor
(MPU)
of
the
asset.
A
key
differentiator
is
that
MicroAI’s
process
of
training
and
forming
a
model
is
unique.
We
train
the
model
directly
on
the
asset
itself.
Not
only
does
this
allow
for
data
to
stay
local,
which
reduces
cost
and
time
of
deployment,
but
it
also
increases
the
accuracy
and
precision
of
the
AI
output.
MicroAI
has
three
primary
layers:
Data
ingestion
&#8211;
MicroAI
is
agnostic
to
data
input.
We
can
consume
any
sensor
value
and
the
MicroAI
Platform
allows
for
feature
engineering
and
weighting
of
the
inputs
within
this
first
layer.
Training
&#8211;
We
train
directly
within
the
local
environment.
The
training
duration
can
be
set
by
the
user
depending
on
what
a
normal
cycle
of
the
asset
is.
Typically,
we
like
to
capture
25-45
normal
cycles,
but
this
is
heavily
based
on
variation/volatility
of
each
cycle
captured.
Output
&#8211;
Notifications
and
Alerts
are
generated
by
MicroAI
based
upon
the
severity
of
the
anomaly
that
is
detected.
These
thresholds
can
be
adjusted
by
the
user.
Other
outputs
generated
by
MicroAI
include
Predicted
Days
to
Next
Maintenance
(for
optimizing
service
schedules),
Health
Score,
and
Asset
Life
Remaining.
These
outputs
can
be
sent
to
existing
IT
systems
that
the
clients
have
in
place
(Product
Lifecycle
Management
tools,
Support/Ticketing
Management,
Maintenance,
etc.)
Can
you
discuss
some
of
the
machine
learning
technologies
behind
MicroAI?
MicroAI
features
a
Multi-Dimensional
Behavioral
Analysis
packed
within
a
recursive
algorithm.
Each
input
that
is
fed
into
the
AI
engine
impacts
the
thresholds
(upper
and
lower
bounds)
that
are
set
by
the
AI
model.
We
do
this
by
providing
a
one
step
ahead
prediction.
For
example,
if
one
input
is
RPMs
and
RPMs
increase,
the
upper-bound
threshold
of
bearing
temperature
may
go
up
slightly
due
to
the
faster
machine
movement.
This
allows
the
model
to
continue
to
evolve
and
learn.
MicroAI
is
not
reliant
on
accessing
the
cloud,
what
are
the
advantages
of
this?
We
have
a
unique
approach
to
forming
models
directly
on
the
endpoint
(where
data
is
generated).
This
brings
data
privacy
and
security
to
deployments
because
data
does
not
need
to
leave
the
local
environment.
This
is
especially
important
for
deployments
where
data
privacy
is
mandatory.
Furthermore,
the
process
of
training
data
in
a
cloud
is
time
consuming.
This
time
consumption
of
how
others
are
approaching
this
space
is
caused
by
the
need
of
aggregating
historical
data,
transmitting
data
to
a
cloud,
forming
a
model,
and
eventually
pushing
that
model
down
to
the
end
assets.
MicroAI
can
train
and
live
100%
in
the
local
environment.
One
of
the
features
of
the
MicroAI
technology
is
its
accelerated
anomaly
detection,
could
you
elaborate
on
this
functionality?
Due
to
our
approach
of
behavioral
analysis,
we
can
deploy
MicroAI
and
instantly
start
learning
the
behavior
of
the
asset.
We
can
start
to
see
patterns
within
the
behavior.
Again,
this
is
without
the
need
of
loading
any
historical
data.
Once
we
capture
sufficient
cycles
of
the
asset,
we
can
then
begin
to
generate
accurate
output
from
the
AI
model.
This
is
groundbreaking
for
the
space.
What
used
to
take
weeks
or
months
to
form
an
accurate
model
can
happen
within
a
matter
of
hours,
and
sometimes
minutes.
What’s
the
difference
between
MicroAI™
Helio
and
MicroAI™
Atom?
MicroAI™
Helio
Server:
Our
Helio
Server
environment
can
be
deployed
in
a
local
server
(most
common),
or
in
a
cloud
instance.
Helio
provides
the
following
functionality:
(Workflow
management,
data
analysis
and
management,
and
data
visualization).
Workflows
for
managing
assets
&#8211; 
A
hierarchy
of
where
they
are
deployed
and
how
they
are
used.
(e.g.,
setup
of
all
customer
facilities
globally,
specific
facilities
and
sections
within
each
facility,
individual
stations,
down
to
each
asset
in
each
station).
Furthermore,
the
assets
may
be
setup
to
perform
different
jobs
with
different
cycle
rates;
this
can
be
configured
within
these
workflows.
In
addition
is
the
ability
for
ticket/workorder
management,
which
is
also
a
part
of
the
Helio
Server
environment.
Data
analysis
and
management
&#8211;
Within
this
section
of
Helio,
a
user
can
run
further
analytics
on
the
AI
output,
along
with
any
raw
data
snapshots
(i.e.,
Max,
Min,
and
average
data
values
on
an
hourly
basis
or
data
signatures
that
triggered
an
 alert
or
an
alarm).
These
can
be
queries
that
are
configured
in
the
Helio
Analytics
designer
or
more
advanced
analytics
brought
in
from
tools
such
as
R,
a
programming
language.
The
data
management
layer
is
where
a
user
can
utilize
the
API
management
gateway
for
3rd-party
connections
that
are
consuming
and/or
sending
data
in
coordination
with
the
Helio
environment.
Data
Visualization
&#8211;
Helio
provides
templates
for
various
industry
specific
reporting,
which
allows
for
users
to
consumer
Enterprise
Asset
Management
and
Asset
Performance
Management
views
of
their
connected
assets
from
both
the
Helio
desktop
and
mobile
applications.
MicroAI
Atom:
MicroAI
Atom
is
a
Machine
Learning
platform
designed
for
embedding
into
MCU
environments.
This
includes
training
of
the
multi-dimensional
behavior
analysis
recursive
algorithm
directly
in
local
MCU
architecture—not
in
a
cloud
and
then
pushed
down
to
the
MCU.
This
allows
for
accelerating
the
build
and
deployment
of
ML
models
through
the
auto-generation
of
the
upper
and
lower
thresholds
based
on
multivariant
model
that
is
formed
directly
on
the
endpoint.
We
have
created
MicroAI
to
be
a
more
efficient
way
of
consuming
and
processing
signal
data
to
train
models
than
other
traditional
methods.
This
not
only
brings
a
higher
level
of
accuracy
to
the
model
that
is
formed
but
utilizes
less
resources
on
the
host
hardware
(i.e.,
lower
memory
and
CPU
usage),
which
allows
us
to
run
in
environments
such
as
an
MCU.
We
have
one
other
core
offering
called
MicroAI™
Network.
MicroAI™
Network
&#8211; Allows
for
a
network
of
Atoms
to
be
consolidated
and
mashed
with
external
data
sources
for
creating
multiple
models
directly
at
the
edge.
This
allows
for
horizontal
and
vertical
analysis
to
be
run
on
the
various
assets
that
are
running
Atom.
MicroAI
Network
allows
for
an
even
deeper
level
of
understanding
to
how
a
device/asset
is
performing
in
relation
to
similar
assets
that
are
deployed.
Again,
due
to
our
unique
approach
to
forming
models
directly
at
the
edge,
the
machine
learning
models
consume
very
little
memory
and
CPU
of
the
host
hardware.
ONE
Tech
also
offers
IoT
security
consulting.
What&#8217;s
the
process
for
threat
modeling
and
IoT
penetration
testing?
Due
to
our
ability
to
understand
how
assets
behave,
we
can
consume
data
related
to
the
internals
of
a
connected
device
(e.g.,
CPU,
Memory
Usage,
data
pack
size/frequency).
IoT
devices
have,
for
the
most
part,
a
regular
pattern
of
operation—how
often
it
transmits
data,
where
it
sends
the
data,
and
the
size
of
that
data
packet.
We
apply
MicroAI
to
consume
these
internal
data
parameters
to
form
a
baseline
of
what
is
normal
for
that
connected
device.
If
an
abnormal
action
occurs
on
the
device,
we
can
trigger
a
response.
This
can
range
from
rebooting
a
device
or
opening
a
ticket
within
a
workorder
management
tool,
to
completely
cutting
network
traffic
to
a
device.
Our
security
team
has
developed
testing
hacks
and
we
have
successfully
detected
various
Zero-Day
attack
attempts
by
using
MicroAI
in
this
capacity.
Is
there
anything
else
that
you
would
like
to
share
about
ONE
Tech,
Inc?
Below
is
a
diagram
of
how
MicroAI
Atom
functions.
Starting
with
acquiring
raw
data,
training
and
processing
in
the
local
environment,
inferencing
the
data
and
providing
output.
Below
is
a
diagram
of
how
MicroAI
Network
functions.
Many
MicroAI
Atoms
feed
into
MicroAI
Network.
Along
with
the
Atom
data,
additional
data
sources
can
be
merged
into
the
model
for
a
more
granular
understanding
of
how
the
asset
is
performing.
Furthermore,
within
MicroAI
Network
multiple
models
are
formed
allowing
stakeholders
to
run
horizontal
analysis
on
how
assets
are
performing
in
different
regions,
between
customers,
before
and
after
updates,
etc.
