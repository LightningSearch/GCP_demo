Zack
Dvey-Aharon,
Ph.D.,
is
the
CEO
and
Co-Founder
of
AEYE
Health
,
a
company
with
a
mission
to
prevent
world
blindness.
With
AEYE
Health&#8217;s
automated
diagnostic
system,
retinal
screening
becomes
accessible
practically
anywhere.
What
initially
attracted
you
to
AI?
I
started
working
on
data
analytics
when
I
was
12
years
old.
Later,
when
I
was
doing
a
Ph.D.
in
machine
learning
at
Tel
Aviv
University,
I
developed
a
fascination
with
machine
learning
and
the
way
it
can
advance
healthcare.
 When
I
researched
heart
data
(phonocardiograms)
and
brain
data
(EEG
and
fMRI),
I
realized
that
if
the
brain
and
the
heart
are
the
engines
of
the
body,
then
the
eyes
are
its
mirror.
With
this
realization,
I
began
exploring
healthcare
of
the
eyes,
and
discovered
the
world
of
retinal
screening.
In
2018,
I
turned
to
my
friend
Danny
Margalit,
former
founder
of
one
of
Israel’s
largest
tech
companies,
he
was
immediately
intrigued
by
the
system
I
started
developing.
He
joined
me
and
together
we
formed
what
later
became
AEYE
Health.
Why
did
you
choose
to
tackle
worldwide
blindness?
Today,
it
is
estimated
that
over
a
billion
people
worldwide
and
75
million
people
in
the
US
alone
are
at
high
risk
of
developing
sight-threatening
conditions.
But
those
estimates
show
that
over
75%
of
them
don’t
get
tested
for
those
conditions.
The
reason
for
this
is
usually
the
high
cost
of
the
testing
or
the
lack
of
easy
access
to
such
screening.
To
me,
this
situation
has
to
change!
That’s
why
we
at
AEYE
Health
have
developed
an
AI-based
retinal
screening
system
which
can
be
easily
integrated
into
existing
fundus
cameras
and
provide
diagnosis
of
the
retina
within
1
minute.
It
is
an
easy,
quick
and
affordable
solution
that
ensures
that
every
high
risk
patient
is
able
to
be
screened
on
an
annual
basis.
How
important
is
an
annual
eye
inspection?
Many
retinal
conditions,
whether
diabetic
retinopathy
(DR),
glaucoma
or
macular
degeneration
develop
over
time
which
makes
early
detection
of
such
conditions
key
to
saving
people’s
eye
sight
–
and
significantly
improve
their
quality
of
life.
It
is
important
to
note
that
DR
is
the
leading
cause
of
blindness
in
American
adults.
What
can
be
learned
by
looking
into
the
human
eye?
Already 
thousands
of
years
ago,
the
Chinese
understood
that
the
eye
is
an
important
diagnostic
tool.
Today,
with
our
technology,
a
retinal
test
can
help
diagnose
various
diseases
including
high
blood
pressure,
heart
disease,
cancer,
Alzheimer’s
and
various
illnesses
that
lead
to
vision
loss.
Can
you
discuss
the
type
of
machine
learning
applications
that
are
used
in
the
AEYE
Diagnostic
System?
We
have
created
algorithms
–
combining artificial
intelligence,
machine
learning
and
computer
vision
technologies
which
are
based
on
hundreds
of
thousands
of
data
examples
and
scan
the
retina
to
diagnose
various
eye
diseases
and
other
ailments.
What
type
of
accuracy
have
you
achieved
for
detections
of
different
issues
such
as
dementia
and
cancer?
Our
trials
are
still
undergoing
so
I
wouldn’t
want
to
disclose
a
specific
number.
All
of
our
retinal
screenings
have
high-quality
results.
We
will
be
happy
to
share
our
analysis
and
the
results
once
they’re
published.
Can
you
discuss
the
process
and
how
long
it
takes
to
get
results?
The
process
is
very
simple
with
results
within
1
minute.
First,
we
take
an
image
of
the
patient’s
retina
using
a
portable,
easy
to
operate
fundus
camera.
At
that
moment,
the
images
are
uploaded
to
our
secure
cloud
system
for
analysis
by
our
AI
algorithms.
The
results
are
sent
back
within
1
minute
–
to
either
a
PC
or
a
mobile
phone.
According
to
the
results,
patients
who
require
further
checks
or
treatments
are
referred
to
ophthalmologists
or
other
relevant
physicians.
Those
whose
tests
came
back
clear
are
asked
to
return
for
the
annual
check
again.
What
type
of
trials
have
been
performed?
Our
company
collaborates
with
healthcare
systems
and
research
institutions
to
analyze
data
of
patients
having
a
wide
range
of
indications
related
to
both
sight-threatening
conditions
and
systemic
diseases.
We
have
performed
dozens
of
different
research
analyses
as
part
of
those
collaborations,
some
of
them
featuring
hundreds
of
thousands
of
patients&#8217;
retinal
images.
As
our
clinical
trials
are
still
ongoing,
I
cannot
disclose
any
further
information
at
the
moment.
How
has
the
medical
community
reacted
to AEYE
Health?
We
have
been
receiving
enthusiastic
responses
from
all
relevant
stakeholders
in
the
medical
community.
The
primary
care
and
endo
clinics
are
excited
to
provide
better
care
to
their
patients.
Normally,
their
patients
are
reluctant
to
visit
the
ophthalmologist
for
a
retinal
screening
test.
With
our
system,
they
are
finally
able
to
screen
their
patients
themselves
and
ensure
they
are
tested
on
the
spot.
Ophthalmologists
who
are
usually
frustrated
because
they
see
too
many
patients
arrive
too
late,
with
severe
retinal
conditions.
These
ophthalmologists
keep
telling
us
how
excited
they
are
now
as
they
see
how
our
solution
will
make
sure
that
they
see
patients
in
a
stage
that
their
condition
is
still
treatable.
We
also
get
great
responses
from
insurance
companies
dealing
with
huge
costs
related
to
retinal
illnesses,
and
see
how
incorporating
our
solution
in
their
system
has huge
potential
benefits
both
in
the
short
and
long
term.
Having
said
that,
I
have
to
say
the
best
responses
we
receive
still
come
from
the
patients.
For
some
of
them,
our
system
finally
provides
accessible
screening
solutions
that
helps
them
protect
their
eye
sight
and
preserve
their
quality
of
life.
Some
have
learned
for
the
first
time
&#8211;
thanks
to
our
technology
&#8211;
that
they
have
a
sight-threatening
condition
that
requires
medical
attention
and
could
lead
to
blindness
if
left
untreated.
Is
there
anything
else
that
you
would
like
to
share
about
AEYE
Diagnostic
System?
Our
goal
is
to
enable
retinal
checks
to
take
place
everywhere
—
pharmacies,
primary
care
settings,
hospitals.
This
requires
not
only
accurate
algorithms
but
to
make
them
work
with
small,
portable
devices
&#8211;
in
real
conditions.
This
is
the
only
way
to
prevent
blindness
and
save
lives.

you
