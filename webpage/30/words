interface.

Our
Technology
Messy
Language.
No
problem.
Our
AI
learns
patterns
in
speech
to
recognize
slang
and
understand
contextual
clues.
This
means
your
customers
can
speak
to
it
as
they
would
speak
to
a
human,
messy,
natural,
and
conversational.
Conversational
Healing
Clinc’s
tech
enables
your
customer
to
change
the
information
they’ve
provided
or
are
seeking
at
any
point
in
the
conversation.
Other
solutions
force
them
to
start
over,
frustrating
your
customers,
and
creating
a
negative
experience.
Context
Retention
Whether
your
customers
are
starting
a
new
conversation
or
picking
up
where
they
left
off
before,
our
technology
retains
history,
ensuring
customers
feel
remembered
and
understood.
