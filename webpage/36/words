Experience
Patented
technology
with
a
focus
on
research
for

Messy
Language.
No
problem.
Our
AI
learns
patterns
in
speech
to
recognize
slang
and
understand
contextual
clues.
This
means
your
customers
can
speak
to
it
as
they
would
speak
to
a
human,
messy,
natural,
and
conversational.
Conversational
Healing
Clinc’s
tech
enables
your
customer
to
change
the
information
they’ve
provided
or
are
seeking
at
any
point
in
the
conversation.
Other
solutions
force
them
to
start
over,
frustrating
your
customers,
and
creating
a
negative
experience.
Context
Retention
Whether
your
customers
are
starting
a
new
conversation
or
picking
up
where
they
left
off
before,
our
technology
retains
history,
ensuring
customers
feel
remembered
and
understood.
Slot
Mapping
Understanding
messy
language
doesn’t
need
to
require
exhaustive
lists
of
synonyms.
With
slot
mapping,
you
can
ensure
your
customers
have
the
best
experience
by
ensuring
they
are
understood
the
first
time.
Data
Curation
Data
is
key
to
conversational
AI,
but
not
all
data
can
be
perfect.
Our
data
curation
tools
make
it
easy
to
clean
up
inconsistent
information
to
make
certain
your
solution
is
production-ready.
Crowd
Sourcing
Source
data
with
our
patented
built-in
crowdsourcing
tool
to
reduce
model
readiness
and
rapidly
create
new
agent
capabilities.

Implement,
Easy

Integrate

easily
integrates
with
your
existing
tech
stack
