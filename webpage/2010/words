Kushal
Chakrabarti
is
the
Vice
President
of
Research
and
Data
Science
at
Opendoor
,
a
leading
digital
platform
for
residential
real
estate.
What
initially
attracted
you
to
machine
learning
and
data
science?
I’ve
always
seen
the
world
in
numbers,
but
it
wasn’t
until
college
that
I
realized
data
science
was
my
true
calling.
And
I
can
pretty
much
pinpoint
the
moment:
“Introduction
to
Programming
with
MATLAB.”
Seeing
that
3D
contour
plot
on
the
MATLAB
splash
screen
was
“Wait
a
minute…”
It
was
like
love
at
first
sight
for
me.
To
me,
data
science
is
the
closest
thing
I’ll
ever
get
to
seeing
the
“mind
of
God.”
Regardless
of
whether
you’re
religious
or
not,
there’s
clearly
an
underlying
mechanism
to
how
the
world
works.
We
don’t
have
the
privilege
of
seeing
it
directly,
but
we
do
get
to
observe
its
artifacts
— data.
And
the
science
and
art
of
reconstructing
that
underlying
mechanism
is
data
science.
Could
you
discuss
some
of
the
evolution
that
you
have
personally
witnessed
in
the
data
science
field
over
the
years?
There’ve
been
two
broad
trends
I’ve
noticed
in
my
nearly
two
decades
in
the
field.
First
is
the
creation
of
sub-disciplines.
When
I
came
up
through
the
ranks,
there
wasn’t
a
distinction
of
data
engineering
vs.
decision
science
vs.
machine
learning.
If
you
wanted
to
do
the
fancy
math,
you
had
to
do
the
rest
as
well
— there
simply
wasn’t
any
other
option.
Today,
given
how
far
the
field
has
come,
people
are
now
starting
to
specialize
in
sub-disciplines.
That’s
inevitable
in
any
maturing
field
— there
were
only
a
few
different
kinds
of
doctors
a
hundred
years
ago,
but
dozens
exist
today.
Second
is
the
broad
democratization
of
the
field.
Today,
a
great
array
of
tools
exist
that
make
the
field
exponentially
more
accessible
to
newcomers.
Although
I
certainly
appreciate
not
having
to
write
C++
code
for
the
forward-backward
algorithm,
it’s
actually
a
double-edged
sword:
many
practitioners
today
treat
those
tools
as
black
boxes
and
don’t
understand
why
certain
things
were
designed
to
work
in
certain
ways,
and
hence
have
difficulty
in
choosing
the
right
tool
for
the
right
job.
What
is
your
current
vision
for
the
future
of
data
science
at
Opendoor?
What
gets
me
up
every
morning
is
building
technology
to
help
everyday
Americans
in
the
real
world.
Buying
or
selling
a
home
is
one
of
the
biggest
milestones
in
a
person’s
lifetime,
and
the
work
we
do
helps
people
across
the
U.S.
achieve
homeownership
in
a
simpler,
more
certain
and
faster
way.
At 
Opendoor
,
we
make
hundreds
of
data-driven
decisions
every
day.
Our
teams
use
everything
from
causal
inference
to
structural
econometric
models
to
deep
learning
that
drive
our
state-of-the-art
pricing
models.
But
when
you
peek
under
the
hood,
there
are
a
lot
of
heuristics.
People
use
heuristics
because
they
work,
but
heuristics
work
in
the
middle
and
fail
at
the
edges.
When
you
think
deeply
about
the
underlying
mechanisms
of
how
people
behave,
you
can
start
abstracting
out
principled
frameworks
that
strictly
generalize
those
heuristics.
It’s
my
vision
and
hope
that
we
build
out
those
principled
frameworks
so
we
can
unlock
easier,
better
and
faster
homeownership
for
millions
more
Americans.
On
your
LinkedIn
profile
you
invite
data
scientists
to
work
with
you
to
solve
a
trillion-dollar
data
science
problem
that
matters
to
a
hundred
million
everyday
Americans.
What
do
you
look
for
in
potential
applicants?
We
fundamentally
look
for
people
with
two
distinguishing
traits:
a
superpower
to
quantitatively
and
systematically
explain
the
world,
and
an
ability
to
pragmatically
work
backwards
from
the
customer.
I
deeply
believe
in
managing
superpowers.
In
my
experience,
the
best
data
scientists
are
T-shaped:
they
know
a
little
about
a
lot,
and
a
lot
about
little.
And
in
my
case,
a
lot
about
very
little!
We
don’t
expect
people
to
know
everything.
We
do,
however,
expect
people
to
be
exceptional
at something.
And
if
you
set
things
up
in
the
right
ways,
you
can
assemble
a
team
of
people
with
complementary
superpowers
that
—
together — can
make
magic
happen.
That’s
not
a
cliche.
As
the
Isaac
Asimov
quote
goes:
“Any
sufficiently
advanced
technology
is
indistinguishable
from
magic.”
Real
estate
is
a
trillion-dollar
industry
that
has
gone
unchanged
for
decades.
We’ve
only
begun
to
scratch
the
surface,
but
we’ve
already
set
the
standard
for
years
to
come.
As
we
bring
on
superpowered
teams
and
drive
forward
our
vision,
we will make
magic.
Check
out
our
open
roles 
here
.
Is
there
anything
else
that
you
would
like
to
share
about
Opendoor?
Given
my
rather
odd
background
— computational
biology
research,
Amazon
personalization,
two-time
startup
founder
and
advisor
to
a
dozen-plus
other
startups
— I’ve
probably
seen
the
inside
of
15-20
data
science
organizations.
I
can
unequivocally
say
that
Opendoor
has
the
most
fascinating
technical
challenges
of
any
organization
I’ve
seen.
Coupled
with
that
is
the
sheer
scale
and
impact
of
what
we
do.
There
simply
aren’t
many
trillion-dollar
problems
in
our
world.
There
certainly
aren’t
many
that
are
operating
in
such
an
archaic
status
quo.
In
just
a
few
years,
we’ve
turned
that
model
on
its
head
and
shown
that
there’s
a
faster,
simpler,
and
more
certain
way
to
do
things
that
combines
the
best
of
sophisticated
data
science
and
customer-centric
operations.
But,
we’ve
just
begun.
Figuring
out
how
we
can
use
new
datasets
and
world-class
data
science
to
get
to
the
next
level
is
an
exhilarating
technical
challenge
that’ll
help
millions
of
Americans
across
the
United
States.
