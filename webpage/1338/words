Michigan
is
at
its
best
when
entrepreneurs
see
a
need
and
create
a
solution

W
hen
the
demand
for
automobiles
arose
in
the
early
1900s,
Ford
Motor
Co.
pioneered
mass
production
to
supply
buyers
with
personal
vehicles.
When
World
War
II
erupted,
the
need
for
military
hardware
mushroomed.
The
auto
industry
stepped
up
once
again
—
this
time
to
assist
the
war
effort
by
manufacturing
weapons,
planes,
trucks,
ships
and
tanks,
securing
Detroit’s
nickname
as
the
Arsenal
of
Democracy.
Michigan
continues
this
pattern,
stepping
forward
again
to
leverage
its
high-tech
talent
and
culture
—
an
Arsenal
of
Innovation
—
to
help
flatten
the
COVID-19
curve
and
move
the
state
toward
recovery.

about
Michigan
companies
that
managed
to
pivot
in
the
pandemic
and
thrive
against
the
odds,
and
which
offer
an
insider’s
look
at
what
they’ve
learned
along
the
way.
