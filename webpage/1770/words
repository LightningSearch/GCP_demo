What
is
Synthetic
Data?
Synthetic
data
is
a
quickly
expanding
trend
and
emerging
tool
in
the
field
of
data
science
.
What
is
synthetic
data
exactly?
The
short
answer
is
that
synthetic
data
is
comprised
of
data
that
isn’t
based
on
any
real-world
phenomena
or
events
,
rather
it’s
generated
via
a
computer
program.
Yet
why
is
synthetic
data
becoming
so
important
for
data
science?
How
is
synthetic
data
created?
Let’s
explore
the
answers
to
these
questions.
What
is
a
Synthetic
Dataset?
As
the
term
“synthetic”
suggests,
synthetic
datasets
are
generated
through
computer
programs,
instead
of
being
composed
through
the
documentation
of
real-world
events.
The
primary
purpose
of
a
synthetic
dataset
is
to
be
versatile
and
robust
enough
to
be
useful
for
the
training
of
machine
learning
models.
In
order
to
be
useful
for
a
machine
learning
classifier,
the
synthetic
data
should
have
certain
properties.
While
the
data
can
be
categorical,
binary,
or
numerical,
the
length
of
the
dataset
should
be
arbitrary
and
the
data
should
be
randomly
generated.
The
random
processes
used
to
generate
the
data
should
be
controllable
and
based
on
various
statistical
distributions.
Random
noise
may
also
be
placed
in
the
dataset.
If
the
synthetic
data
is
being
used
for
a
classification
algorithm,
the
amount
of
class
separation
should
be
customizable,
in
order
that
the
classification
problem
can
be
made
easier
or
harder
according
to
the
problem’s
requirements.
Meanwhile,
for
a
regression
task,
non-linear
generative
processes
can
be
employed
to
generate
the
data.
Why
Use
Synthetic
Data?
As
machine
learning
frameworks
like
TensorfFlow
and
PyTorch
become
easier
to
use
and
pre-designed
models
for
computer
vision
and
natural
language
processing
become
more
ubiquitous
and
powerful,
the
primary
problem
that
data
scientists
must
face
is
the
collection
and
handling
of
data.
Companies
often
have
difficulty
acquiring
large
amounts
of
data
to
train
an
accurate
model
within
a
given
time
frame.
Hand-labeling
data
is
a
costly,
slow
way
to
acquire
data.
However,
generating
and
using
synthetic
data
can
help
data
scientists
and
companies
overcome
these
hurdles
and
develop
reliable
machine
learning
models
a
quicker
fashion.
There
are
a
number
of
advantages
to
using
synthetic
data.
The
most
obvious
way
that
the
use
of
synthetic
data
benefits
data
science
is
that
it
reduces
the
need
to
capture
data
from
real-world
events,
and
for
this
reason
it
becomes
possible
to
generate
data
and
construct
a
dataset
much
more
quickly
than
a
dataset
dependent
on
real-world
events.
This
means
that
large
volumes
of
data
can
be
produced
in
a
short
timeframe.
This
is
especially
true
for
events
that
rarely
occur,
as
if
an
event
rarely
happens
in
the
wild,
more
data
can
be
mocked
up
from
some
genuine
data
samples.
Beyond
that,
the
data
can
be
automatically
labeled
as
it
is
generated,
drastically
reducing
the
amount
of
time
needed
to
label
data.
Synthetic
data
can
also
be
useful
to
gain
training
data
for
edge
cases,
which
are
instances
that
may
occur
infrequently
but
are
critical
for
the
success
of
your
AI.
Edge
cases
are
events
that
are
very
similar
to
the
primary
target
of
an
AI
but
differ
in
important
ways.
For
instance,
objects
that
are
only
partially
in
view
could
be
considered
edge
cases
when
designing
an
image
classifier.
Finally,
synthetic
datasets
can
minimize
privacy
concerns.
Attempts
to
anonymize
data
can
be
ineffective,
as
even
if
sensitive/identifying
variables
are
removed
from
the
dataset,
other
variables
can
act
as
identifiers
when
they
are
combined.
This
isn’t
an
issue
with
synthetic
data,
as
it
was
never
based
on
a
real
person,
or
real
event,
in
the
first
place.
Uses
Cases
for
Synthetic
Data
Synthetic
data
has
a
wide
variety
of
uses
,
as
it
can
be
applied
to
just
about
any
machine
learning
task.
Common
use
cases
for
synthetic
data
include
self-driving
vehicles,
security,
robotics,
fraud
protection,
and
healthcare.
One
of
the
initial
use
cases
for
synthetic
data
was
self-driving
cars,
as
synthetic
data
is
used
to
create
training
data
for
cars
in
conditions
where
getting
real,
on-the-road
training
data
is
difficult
or
dangerous.
Synthetic
data
is
also
useful
for
the
creation
of
data
used
to
train
image
recognition
systems,
like
surveillance
systems,
much
more
efficiently
than
manually
collecting
and
labeling
a
bunch
of
training
data.
Robotics
systems
can
be
slow
to
train
and
develop
with
traditional
data
collection
and
training
methods.
Synthetic
data
allows
robotics
companies
to
test
and
engineer
robotics
systems
through
simulations.
Fraud
protection
systems
can
benefit
from
synthetic
data,
and
new
fraud
detection
methods
can
be
trained
and
tested
with
data
that
is
constantly
new
when
synthetic
data
is
used.
In
the
healthcare
field,
synthetic
data
can
be
used
to
design
health
classifiers
that
are
accurate,
yet
preserve
people’s
privacy,
as
the
data
won’t
be
based
on
real
people.
Synthetic
Data
Challenges
While
the
use
of
synthetic
data
brings
many
advantages
with
it,
it
also
brings
many
challenges.
When
synthetic
data
is
created,
it
often
lacks
outliers.
Outliers
occur
in
data
naturally,
and
while
often
dropped
from
training
datasets,
their
existence
may
be
necessary
to
train
truly
reliable
machine
learning
models.
Beyond
this,
the
quality
of
synthetic
data
can
be
highly
variable.
Synthetic
data
is
often
generated
with
an
input,
or
seed,
data,
and
therefore
the
quality
of
the
data
can
be
dependent
on
the
quality
of
the
input
data.
If
the
data
used
to
generate
the
synthetic
data
is
biased,
the
generated
data
can
perpetuate
that
bias.
Synthetic
data
also
requires
some
form
of
output/quality
control.
It
needs
to
be
checked
against
human-annotated
data,
or
otherwise
authentic
data
is
some
form.
How
Is
Synthetic
Data
Created?
Synthetic
data
is
created
programmatically
with
machine
learning
techniques.
Classical
machine
learning
techniques
like
decision
trees
can
be
used,
as
can
deep
learning
techniques
.
The
requirements
for
the
synthetic
data
will
influence
what
type
of
algorithm
is
used
to
generate
the
data.
Decision
trees
and
similar
machine
learning
models
let
companies
create
non-classical,
multi-modal
data
distributions,
trained
on
examples
of
real-world
data.
Generating
data
with
these
algorithms
will
provide
data
that
is
highly
correlated
with
the
original
training
data.
For
instances
where
the
typical
distribution
of
data
is
known
,
a
company
can
generate
synthetic
data
through
use
of
a
Monte
Carlo
method.
Deep
learning
-based
methods
of
generating
synthetic
data
typically
make
use
of
either
a
variational
autoencoder
(VAE)
or
a
generative
adversarial
network
(GAN)
.
VAEs
are
unsupervised
machine
learning
models
that
make
use
of
encoders
and
decoders.
The
encoder
portion
of
a
VAE
is
responsible
for
compressing
the
data
down
into
a
simpler,
compact
version
of
the
original
dataset,
which
the
decoder
then
analyzes
and
uses
to
generate
an
a
representation
of
the
base
data.
A
VAE
is
trained
with
the
goal
of
having
an
optimal
relationship
between
the
input
data
and
output,
one
where
both
input
data
and
output
data
are
extremely
similar.
When
it
comes
to
GAN
models,
they
are
called
“adversarial”
networks
due
to
the
fact
that
GANs
are
actually
two
networks
that
compete
with
each
other.
The
generator
is
responsible
for
generating
synthetic
data,
while
the
second
network
(the
discriminator)
operates
by
comparing
the
generated
data
with
a
real
dataset
and
tries
to
determine
which
data
is
fake.
When
the
discriminator
catches
fake
data,
the
generator
is
notified
of
this
and
it
makes
changes
to
try
and
get
a
new
batch
of
data
by
the
discriminator.
In
turn,
the
discriminator
becomes
better
and
better
at
detecting
fakes.
The
two
networks
are
trained
against
each
other,
with
fakes
becoming
more
lifelike
all
the
time.
