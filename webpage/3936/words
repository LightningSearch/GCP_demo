Three-time
Finovate
Best
of
Show-winner
LearnVest
has
agreed
to
be
acquired
by
insurance
giant
Northwestern
Mutual.
As
reported
in
Fortune.com,
the
company
was
bought
for
more
than
$250
million
in
cash
.
LearnVest
CEO
and
founder
Alexa
von
Tobel
said
that
her
company&#8217;s
acquisition
by
Northwestern
Mutual
will
only
extend
her
mission
to
bring
&#8220;affordable,
accessible,
and
delightful
&#8230;
unbiased
financial
planning&#8221;
to
a
broader
range
of
American
households.
Von
Tobel
will
remain
Chief
Executive
of
the
company,
which
will
serve
as
an
independent
subsidiary
of
Northwestern
Mutual,
maintaining
its
LearnVest
brand.

CEO
and

at
FinovateFall
2013
in
New
York.
LearnVest
combines
a
free,
online
PFM platform
with
the
opportunity
to
work
with
professional,
human
financial
advisors
for
a
one-time
set-up
fee
of
$299
and
$19/month
for
ongoing
support.
Tim
Schaefer,
executive
vice
president
of
operations
and
technology
at
Northwestern
Mutual
said,
&#8220;We
see
that
from
an
innovation
standpoint,
there&#8217;s
a
real
opportunity
to
bring
together
cutting-edge
technology
with
that
human
touch.&#8221;
And
with Learnvest
the
second
big
finech
acquisition
of
the
week
(
Kofax
being
the
first),
it
is
all
the
more
interesting
to
consider
the
take
from
Inc.com&#8217;s
Jeremy
Quittner
,
who
suggested
that
acquisition
may
sometimes
be
a
preferable
&#8220;exit
strategy&#8221;
than
an
IPO
for
startups.
LearnVest
had
raised
$70
million
in
funding
from
15
investors
,
according
to
Crunchbase,
and
was
valued
at
more
than
a
&#8220;cool
quarter-billion&#8221;
last
spring
during
its
most
recent
funding
round.
LearnVest
won
Best
of
Show
honors
at
each
of
its
three
Finovate
appearances
(
FinovateFall
2011
,
FinovateFall
2012
,
and
FinovateFall
2013
).
The
company
was
founded
in
2009
and
is
headquartered
in
New
York
City.
