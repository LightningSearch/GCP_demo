This

While
2020
made
its
mark
on
the
financial
industry
by
causing
tremendous
disruption,
2021
is
shaping
up
to
be
a
year
remembered
for
transformation
and
adaptation.
Companies
are
hard
at
work
building
new
digital
strategies
that
will
help
them
to
thrive
in
an
increasingly
volatile
economy.
Fintech
developers
are
taking
up
the
challenge
to
meet
the
functionality
and
performance
demands
of
the
financial
industry
as
firms
embrace
true
digital
transformation.
Their
ability
to
build
applications
that
deliver
new
features
and
integrate
new
capabilities
into
legacy
solutions
will
be
critical
for
helping
firms
reshape
existing
technology
infrastructures.
Top
5
Fintech
Trends
to
Watch
in
2021
1.
Customer-First
Solutions
With
so
many
fintech
applications
to
choose
from,
financial
organizations
must
take
the
time
to
consider
which
solutions
are
best
suited
for
the
needs
of
their
customers.
Banks
and
investment
firms
once
put
their
own
needs
at
the
center
of
their
processes,
but
in
an
increasingly
competitive
marketplace,
they
have
realized
that
providing
a
high-quality
user
experience
is
paramount
to
success.
They
can
begin
transforming
processes
by
eliminating
friction
to
allow
customers
to
access
the
services
and
products
they
need
more
quickly.
Fintech
developers
can
help
them
to
eliminate
manual
processes,
reduce
external
dependencies,
and
automate
common
tasks
by
designing
unified
digital
solutions
that
address
multiple
challenges
and
streamline
workflows.
By
integrating
features
like
document
viewing,
file
conversion,
and
form
data
capture
into
their
applications,
innovative
developers
are
finding
ways
to
strengthen
the
connection
between
firms
and
their
customers.
2.
Enhancing
Digital
Collaboration
In
response
to
the
COVID-19
pandemic,
much
of
the
financial
industry
has
embraced
remote
work
arrangements
for
the
foreseeable
future.
The
transition
has
created
significant
demand
for
digital
tools
that
can
facilitate
effective
and
secure
collaboration.
Not
only
must
physical
documents
be
converted
into
digital
form,
but
firms
also
need
ways
to
make
those
files
available
to
remote
employees
without
threatening
data
security
or
causing
version
confusion.
Organizations
frequently
turn
to
a
variety
of
incompatible
software
solutions
and
improvised
workarounds
to
meet
their
viewing,
editing,
and
document
management
needs
rather
than
implementing
a
dedicated,
all-in-one
solution.
Unfortunately,
these
ad
hoc
measures
create
inefficient
third-party
dependencies,
expose
data
to
unnecessary
risk,
and
make
human
error
more
likely.
Fintech
developers
can
integrate
these
features
into
a
single
application
through
the
use
of
SDKs
and
web-based
APIs.
3.
Managing
Big
Data
Financial
services
firms
gather
massive
quantities
of
data
on
a
regular
basis.
Although
much
of
that
data
is
unstructured
and
needs
to
be
filtered
through
sophisticated
algorithms
to
bring
notable
trends
and
risks
to
the
forefront,
the
industry
also
collects
a
great
deal
of
data
from
structured
forms
.
Structured
documents
such
as
loan
applications,
tax
filings,
and
financial
statements
all
provide
valuable
data
insights
that
organizations
can
use
to
make
more
informed
strategic
decisions.
Fintech
applications
with
the
ability
to
extract
and
process
data
from
structured
forms
accurately
is
essential
for
improving
the
performance
of
powerful
analytics
tools
deployed
by
today’s
financial
firms.
Software
integrations
can
further
enhance
fintech
solutions
with
image
cleanup,
document
alignment,
and
form
recognition
features
that
make
the
data
collection
process
more
efficient
and
accurate.
4.
Disaster
Mitigation
After
seeing
how
the
COVID-19
pandemic
caused
massive
disruption
to
global
markets
and
supply
chains,
financial
organizations
are
reviewing
the
way
they
do
business
to
reduce
the
impact
of
similar
disasters
in
the
future.
One
of
the
key
steps
in
this
process
will
be
the
rapid
transition
to
paperless
workflows
and
an
expansion
of
electronic
data
capture
capabilities
to
reduce
the
reliance
upon
manual
processes.
Solutions
that
incorporate
streamlined
document
viewing,
file
conversion
capabilities,
and
data
extraction
tools
will
be
essential
to
these
“disaster
proofing”
efforts.
By
automating
previously
manual
tasks,
such
as
data
entry,
document
assembly,
and
signature
authentication,
Fintech
solutions
can
help
financial
companies
protect
their
business
processes
from
future
disruptions.
5.
Expanded
Partnership
Opportunities
Although
traditional
financial
institutions
like
banks
have
been
skeptical
of
many
fintech
solutions,
the
rapidly-changing
market
has
caused
them
to
reassess
their
technology
in
order
to
reach
a
new
generation
of
customers.
Collaboration
between
banks
and
innovative
fintech
startups
was
already
on
the
rise
before
the
pandemic
reduced
longstanding
barriers
to
digital
transformation.
The
challenge
they
now
face
is
how
to
integrate
their
operations
and
data
while
also
launching
innovative
services
across
multiple
channels.
Fintech
developers
can
streamline
this
process
by
building
flexible
software
applications
capable
of
handling
a
variety
of
file
formats
without
the
need
for
any
burdensome
third-party
dependencies.
In
some
cases,
that
may
mean
building
entirely
new
solutions,
while
in
others
it
might
call
for
integrating
additional
features
into
firmly
entrenched
legacy
applications.
The
fintech
companies
with
the
ability
to
get
innovative
software
platforms
to
market
more
quickly
will
be
able
to
make
the
most
of
their
partnership
opportunities.
Building
Better
FinTech
Solutions
with
Accusoft
Accusoft’s
diverse
library
of
SDKs
and
APIs
allows
developers
to
easily
integrate
robust
content
processing,
conversion,
and
automation
capabilities

to
give
their
web
applications
the
ability
to
natively
view,
edit,
and
convert
documents,
extracting
data
from
multiple
form
types
with
FormSuite
for
Structured
Forms
,
or
building
image
cleanup,
OCR,
and
PDF
annotation
features

and
the
years
to
come.

thrown
a
spotlight
on
the
inefficiencies
underlying
many
functional
areas
of
financial
firms
and
caused
executives
to
reevaluate
operational
resilience

change
management
to
improving
the
client
experience.
AI
has
huge
potential
to
augment
and
transform
current
market
practices,
but
organizations
need
to
make
sure
they
are
laying
the
groundwork
for
successful
implementation
by
considering
the
underlying
data
infrastructure
required
to
turn
these
technology
ambitions
into

Digital
exhibitor,
Invest
Puerto
Rico.
Puerto

the
global
model
for
how
to
roll
out
cutting-edge
tools
that
enable

AI,
and
the
Internet
of
Things
(IoT).
All
of
these
technologies
are
designed
to
transform
nearly
every
sector,
notably
financial
services,
bioscience,
and
aerospace.
Technology
represents
the
changes
imminent
in
the
4th
industrial
revolution.
Proper
implementation
and
growth
of
these
tools
has
been
a
critical
priority
contributing
to
the
island’s
economic
diversity,
development,
and
competitiveness.
Network
Advances
in
these
fields
would
not

Technology
(ICT)
network.
As
an
island,
Puerto
Rico
depends
on
its
ability
to
communicate
with
the
world
to
do
business.
As
such,
companies
benefit
from
extensive
island-wide
5G,
broadband
access,
established
LoRa
network
capabilities,
and
broad
satellite
connections.
Every
element
of
this
network
ensures
producers
are
connected
to
suppliers,
customers,
and
business
partners.
Puerto
Rico’s
tech
expertise
and
nationally
unique
international
banking
policies—along
with
the
growing
demand
for
effective
financial
solutions
and
resources—has
led
to
a
boom
in
innovative
fintech
and
investing
services
that
extend
to
every
industry.
Fintech
Fintech
is
growing
fast,
at
a
rate
of
25%
per
year
through
2022.
Puerto
Rico’s
close
proximity
to
the
world’s
financial
center
–
New

City
–
gives
island-based
fintech
firms
the
opportunity
to
remain
connected
while
taking
advantages
of
key
local
benefits
such
as
STEM
talent,
local
financial
literacy,
and
attractive
tax
incentives.
Puerto
Ricans
are
open
to
technology
providing
financial
solutions
where
traditional
banks
do
not.
Here
are
a
few
facts
you
might
have
known
about
the
island.
In
2017,
Puerto
Rican
firm
Evertec
was
the
#1
provider
of
payment
processing
services
in
Latin
America,
exporting
financial
services
to
25
countries
around
the
world
After
just
four
years,
Evertec’s
money
transfer
platform,
ATH
Movil
,
reached
over
1
million
users,
6,000
businesses,
and
80%
of
banks
and
credit
unions
Banco
Popular’s
digital
platform
also
leads

recognized
payment
processing
technology.
Banking
with
digital
assets
is
quickly
becoming

and
insurance
industries
by
providing
banks
and
insurers,
companies,
and
individuals
unparalleled

Fintech
Digital
Transformation
Challenges
During
COVID-19

The
following
is
a
sponsored
post
by
Tracy
Schlabach,
Senior
Manager,
Product
and
Customer
Marketing,
Accusoft.
Digital
transformation
has
been
on
the
radar
of
most
financial
institutions
for
years.
In
a
2020
Digital
Transformation
Survey
by
BDO
of
financial
services
professionals,
68%
of
respondents
in
2019
saw
a
growth
in
revenue
directly
related
to
digital
investments.
While
many
have
made
digital
transformation
a
priority,
some
have
faced
roadblocks
including
risk-aversion
and
lack
of
corporate
sponsorship.
With
COVID-19
sweeping
the
globe,
priorities
are
shifting,
emphasizing
the
need
for
digital
transformation.&nbsp;
As
noted
in
a
state
of
the
industry
report
authored
by
the
Institute
of
International
Finance
and
Deloitte
,
“COVID-19
has
generated
leadership
and
organizational
support
by
highlighting
the
need
for
digital
transformation
as
a
means
to
reach
customers
and
maintain
operational
resilience.”
Of
those
surveyed
by
BDO
prior
to
the
COVID-19
outbreak,
36%
see
industry
disruption
as
the
primary
digital
threat.
In
addition,
a
recent
survey
by
IDG
Research
states
that
59%
of
respondents
are
seeing
an
acceleration
of
digital
transformation
in
their
companies
driven
by
the
pandemic.
Now
that
implementing
the
digital
strategy
has
taken
center
stage
on
the
fintech
roadmap,
developers
are
looking
to
meet
the
needs
of
leadership
as
well
as
customers
and
employees
in
a
timely
and
budget
efficient
manner.
What
Is
Digital
Transformation?
The
name
digital
transformation
embodies
a
wide
assortment
of
initiatives,
from
the
customer
engagement
experience
to
transforming
legacy
systems.
In
an
article
by
The
Financial
Brand
,
financial
executives
were
asked
to
select
their
top
digital
transformation
priorities
for
2021.
Out
of
the
long
list
of
initiatives,
four
of
the
highest
priorities
are:
Improve
Customer
Experience
Improve
Use
of
Data,
Analytics,
and
AI
Enhance
Innovation
Agility
Improve
Back
Office
Efficiency
Financial
institutions
are
prioritizing
several
diverse
initiatives
to
remain
relevant
during
the
global
pandemic.
Project
managers
need
to
shorten
development
time,
meet
executive
mandates,
and
launch
products
that
significantly
improve
the
employee
and
customer
experience.
SDK
and
API
Integrations
Streamline
Fintech
Development
Development
teams
can
effectively
meet
those
timelines
by
partnering
with
software
manufacturers
who
build
and
maintain
software
development
kits
(SDKs)
and
application
programming
interfaces
(APIs).
Developers
can
integrate
these
SDKs
and
APIs
into
their
product
offerings
to
add
unique
document
processing
capabilities.
By
partnering
with
a
high-tech
software
solution,
your
team
can
save
development
time,
shorten
sprints,
and
reduce
maintenance
cost.
While
these
are
significant
benefits,
partnering
and
integrating
third-party
software
manufacturers
come
with
many
advantages,
including
the
ability
to:
Remove
the
burden
of
building
and
maintaining
extensive
document
processing
libraries
Access
the
manufacturer’s
support
and
engineering
team
who
can
assist
with
implementation
and
resolve
issues
Significantly
reduce
time
to
market
of
your
product
Let’s
take
a
deeper
look
at
each
of
these
advantages.
Integrate
vs.
Build
&amp;
Maintain
Document
Processing
Libraries
&#8211;
Consider
how
many
different
file
formats
are
available
in
the
market
for
submitting
data
to
financial
institutions. 
Fintech
users
receive
everything
from
Word
documents
to
PDFs
to
images
taken
with
cell
phones.
All
of
those
file
formats
need
to
be
taken
into
consideration
when
building
a
fintech
application
that
streamlines
the
process
of
capturing
data
from
those
files.
Building
out
libraries
of
code
that
can
address
every
possible
option
is
extremely
cumbersome
and
time-consuming. 
However,
developers
can
leverage
an
SDK
or
API
that
has
been
developed
specifically
for
document
processing
and
open
up
time
to
focus
on
their
core
competencies.
Access
to
Support
and
Engineering
Experts
&#8211;
When
financial
institutions
embed
third-party
document
and
image
processing
solutions,
they
are
also
gaining
access
to
a
team
of
experts.
At
Accusoft,
each
customer
has
access
to
technical
support
and
product
developers
that
have
helped
hundreds
of
companies
with
implementing
and
utilizing
these
document
processing
SDKs
and
APIs.
Digital
transformation
is
a
pressing
concern
for
financial
organizations.
You
can
help
them
meet
their
needs
with
our
SDKs
and
APIs.
Get
this
new
functionality
up
and
running
quickly
in
your
application
so
your
developers
can
focus
on
more
mission-critical
tasks.
Reduce
Time
to
Market
&#8211;
As
noted
in
the
report
by
BDO,
“Most
financial
services
companies
anticipate
high
returns
on
revenue
and
profitability
from
digital
transformation.”
Project
managers
that
prioritize
research
and
implement
third-party
software
solutions
can
significantly
reduce
the
time
to
market.
This,
in
turn,
will
allow
their
company
to
realize
profits
faster
than
their
competition.
With
the
recent
changes
in
the
world,
the
need
for
digital
transformation
is
not
slowing
down.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Financial
institutions
that
prioritize
those
initiatives
and
research
ways
to
develop
and
implement
their
new
offerings
quickly
will
be
ahead
in
realizing
revenues
and
returning
profits
to
shareholders.

Order
to
Hyper-Personalize

The
following
is
a
sponsored
post
from
InterSystems,
Gold
Sponsors
of&nbsp;
FinovateWest
Digital
,
November
23
through
25,
2020.
In
an
increasingly
digital
world
filled
with
chatbots,
tap-and-go
payments,
and
“buy
now,
pay
later”
credit
lines,&nbsp;
hyper-personalization
&nbsp;is
the
new
frontier
on
top
of
a
new
frontier
in
financial
services.
What
is
hyper-personalization?
Hyper-personalization
enables
financial
services
organizations
to
leverage
the
huge
volumes
of&nbsp;
customer
data
&nbsp;they
have
in
their
systems
efficiently
and
effectively
to
make
more
specific
and
more
relevant
product
recommendations,
such
as
an
increase
of
a
credit
limit
at
the
point
of
sale,
or
a
list
of
previous
interactions
pushed
to
the
chatbot,
allowing
it
to
pick
up
where
it
last
left
off.
It
does
so
by
analyzing
the
data
available
to
it
through
the
power
of
analytics,
artificial
intelligence
(AI),
and
machine
learning.
It
offers
immense
growth
opportunities
for
all
financial
services
providers
if
they
can
cater
to
small
and
specific
groups.
Hyper-personalization
can
foster
loyalty
in
an
era
in
which
loyalty
has
declined,
and
it
pushes
the
next
generation
of
consumers
and
investors
towards
those
financial
services
which
can
be
agile
in
what
they
offer.
Traditional
firms
and
hyper-personalization
Traditional
firms
are
often
encumbered
by
processes
built
up
over
decades.
These
processes
are
ingrained
and
necessary
for
them
to
have
operated
the
way
they
have
successfully
and
for
so
long.
To
these
firms,
those
same
processes
hinder
the
uptake
of
advances
such
as
AI,
data
analytics
and
machine
learning.
Yet
these
and
other
new
technologies
do
not
require
traditional
firms
to
re-imagine
how
processes
work,
nor
does
implementing
have
to
be
as
obtrusive
and
disruptive
as
a
full
digital
transformation
initiative,
for
example.
Rather,
technology
can
be
implemented
in
the
background
and
effectively
manage
itself,
be
installed
quickly
and
efficiently
in
existing
systems
without
disrupting
the
rest
of
the
business.
Some
can
even
run
adjacently
to
everything
else
the
business
does.
Traditional
firms
have
decades
or
more
worth
of
data.
Analytics
tools,
AI,
and
machine
learning
work
together
to
make
sense
of
it
all,
wherever
it
might
be
and
in
whatever
language
it
might
be
in,
and
surface
actionable
insights
from
all
of
it.
Importantly,
these
technologies
work
in
the
background,
without
disrupting
any
mission-critical
processes.
How
can
traditional
firms
hyper-personalize?
Traditional
firms
can
deploy
a&nbsp;
smart
&nbsp;
data
fabric
,
which
is
effectively
a
layer
which
sits
above
all
of
the
firm’s
available
endpoints
and
distributed
services
—
whether
it
be
in
the&nbsp;
cloud,
on-premise
or
both
&nbsp;—
and
ensures
those
endpoints
and
their
capabilities
speak
the
same
language.
Next,
the
data
needs
to
be
put
through
proper
governance
procedures
to
ensure
it
is
clean,
relevant
and
has
the
necessary
integrity
to
be
used
with
confidence
for
the
right
reasons
by
the
organization
—
it
needs
to
be
accurate,
reliable,
complete,
appropriate,
and
credible.
For
this
to
occur,
it
goes
through
something
of
a
digital
centrifuge
which
analyses
its
health
and
cleans
it
before
having
it
ready
for
primetime.
Once
this
is
done,
the
rich
streams
of
data
inherent
across
the
company
can
be
mined,
analyzed,
and
surfaced
using
the
power
of
AI
and
machine
learning.
This
may
sound
like
a
lot
of
steps
and
go
against
the
grain
of
what
we’ve
been
discussing
in
this
article.
But
rest
assured,
all
of
these
technologies
can
be
implemented
with
little
to
no
disruption
to
operations,
and
they
work
in
the
background
while
delivering
key
insights
for
the
data
almost
in
real-time.
It’s
through
using
these
technologies
that
traditional
firms
can,
at
last,
unlock
those
rich
and
extensive
streams
of
historical
data
dating
back
decades,
which
in
turn
provides
a
clear
method
to
fostering
loyalty.
Research
shows
that
customers
want
a
hyper-personalized
experience.
According
to
Accenture,&nbsp;
91
percent
of
consumers
&nbsp;are
more
likely
to
shop
with
brands
who
recognize
them,
remember
them,
and
provide
them
with
relevant
offers
and
recommendations.
Conclusion
Traditional
firms
have
a
hyper-personalization
advantage
thanks
to
possessing
a
trove
of
legacy
data
and
brand
recognition.
They
just
need
to
embrace
what
is
available
to
help
leverage
their
data
and
analytics
to
get
them
to
their
intelligent
future
—
and
trust
that
it
can
and
will
co-exist
with
existing
processes.
If
they
allow
technology
to
do
the
heavy
lifting
for
them
alongside
their
existing
processes,
traditional
firms
will
be
able
to
leverage
decades
of
data
to
their
advantage
and
engage
in
new
ways
with
customers,
without
having
to
re-invent
the
wheel.

How
Wealth
Management

Can

Client

Ahead
of
FinovateFall
Digital
next
week,
we
hear
from
Chad
Hamblin,
Global
Industry
Director
of
Financial
Services
at
Microsoft
,
one
of
Finovate&#8217;s
Gold
Sponsors.
Hamblin
explores
why
success
will
come
down
to
understanding
and
empathizing
with
your
client
.
Dig
a
little
deeper
into
this
topic
with
Microsoft&#8217;s
eBook
on
the
topic:
Reimagine
the
client
experience
in
wealth
management
.
COVID-19
has
put
a
strain
on
everyone.
We’ve
all
navigated
social
isolation,
uncertain
investment
projections,
and
remote
work
environments.
Regardless
of
the
experience,
this
time
away
has
left
a
haze
over
individuals
and
organizations
alike.
We’re
not
just
unsure
what
comes
next,
we’re
questioning
the
very
processes
we’ve
accepted
to
this
point.
Investors
are
feeling
a
new
tension
that
makes
small
pain
points
all
the
more
obvious.
Voice
automation,
fixed
fees,
commissions
—
what
clients
once
accepted
as
the
cost
of
doing
business
are
suddenly
under
intense
scrutiny.
Clients
aren’t
obligated
to
trust
a
major
firm
with
their
financial
future,
and
now
they’re
acting
on
the
opportunity
to
move
their
money
elsewhere.
So
how
can
wealth
management
firms
adapt
their
strategies
(and
identities)
to
regain
that
trust?
It
all
starts
with
understanding
the
client.
A
holistic
experience
Over
the
years,
many
wealth
firms
operated
under
a
one-size-fits-most
model
—
if
the
client
fell
into
a
specific
demographic,
then
the
firm
provided
a
specific
portfolio.
Empowered
by
the
Digital
Age
and
amplified
by
this
pandemic,
a
growing
number
of
modern
clients
are
looking
for
a
wealth
management
partner—someone
willing
to
listen
to
their
ambitions,
dreams,
and
goals
and
recommend
actions
catered
to
their
unique
circumstances.
These
clients
want
to
feel
identified,
seen,
and
valued;
they
want
to
feel
like
more
than
an
account
number.
Organizations
can
deliver
on
that
expectation
by
creating
a
holistic
client
experience
—
a
strategic
client
approach
that
uses
technology
and
relationship-building
to
create
a
more
inclusive
perspective
on
the
client’s
needs,
interests,
and
ambitions.
Delivering
a
holistic
client
experience
comes
to
life
in
three
ways:
portfolios,
services,
and
communications.
Holistic
portfolios
&nbsp;understand
the
client’s
dreams,
goals,
and
life
events
and
work
to
build
the
right
mix
of
investments
to
meet
that
individual’s
financial
plan,
risk
preference,
and
goals.
By
moving
away
from
cookie-cutter
portfolios
and
embracing
a
consultative
approach,
advisors
create
a
partnership
built
on
trust.
Holistic
services
&nbsp;encourage
firms
to
expand
their
capabilities
to
adapt
to
a
changing
world.
In
the
last
decade,
clients
have
become
jaded
by
fixed-fee
models.
At
the
same
time,
online
resources
have
made
wealth
management
more
accessible.
By
shifting
to
a
holistic
client
model,
organizations
expand
their
services
beyond
portfolio
management
and
provide
added-value
services
like
financial
advice
and
planning,
risk
mitigation,
goal
tracking,
wealth
building
strategies,
and
even
bring
in
experts
for
specialized
areas
like
real
estate,
education
planning,
tax
mitigation,
and
estate
planning.
By
expanding
into
capabilities
that
they
may
not
have
focused
on
before,
wealth
management
firms
further
align
with
the
individual
goals
of
their
clients
and
can
offer
one-stop
solutions.
Likewise,&nbsp;
holistic
communication
&nbsp;leverages
the
client’s
communication
preference.
Every
company
has
multiple
engagement
channels—voice,
text,
email,
chat,
video,
social
media,
etc.—but
most
organizations
assume
that
every
client
wants
to
be
contacted
via
every
channel.
Yet,
modern
tools
can
equip
firms
to
democratize
their
client
data
to
share
information
and
insights.
By
consolidating
data
and
communication
streams
into
a
single
hub
of
truth
and
by
providing
that
information
via
client-friendly
channels,
wealth
management
firms
can
ensure
that
clients
are
engaged
in
the
mediums
they
prefer.
Adapting
in
real
time
It
won&#8217;t
be
enough
to
lag
behind
your
clients,
real
time
adaptations
and
analysis
will
count.
While
holistic
client
experiences
serve
as
the
star
of
wealth
management’s
future,
next-generation
technologies
will
be
the
foundation
of
these
efforts.
Trending
tools
like
AI,
life
event
and
goal
tracking,
market
risk
analysis,
smart
portfolio
allocation,
and
project
automation
equip
organizations
with
the
tools
they
need
to
build
more
responsive,
reliable
offerings
for
clients.
Imagine
how
predictive
analytic
tools
will
help
determine
the
stability
of
future
investments
or
the
time
employees
could
save
on
data
entry
through
automation.
Today’s
technologies
grant
employees
the
tools
they
need
to
deliver
a
holistic
customer
experience
by
making
their
day-to-day
tasks
more
efficient
and
effective.
Investing
in
trust
By
creating
a
holistic
client
experience,
wealth
management
firms
become
a
reliable
asset
during
hardship
and
a
celebrated
ally
in
victories.
Right
now,
clients
around
the
world
are
reassessing
their
investments
for
fear
of
a
future
crisis.
In
many
cases,
COVID-19
has
fundamentally
upset
the
way
many
clients
view
wealth
management
and
building.
It’s
up
to
firms
to
empathize
with
those
concerns
and
shape
their
efforts
to
bring
peace
of
mind.
With
a
multitude
of
wealth
firms
fighting
for
their
dollars,
today’s
clients
are
increasingly
taking
their
funds
to
firms
that
demonstrate
a
conscious
effort
to
understand
their
ambitions
beyond
executing
trades.
Wealth
management
firms
that
position
themselves
as
true
advisors
and
champion
the
hopes
and
dreams
of
their
clients
can
foster
trusting
and
long-lasting
relationships.
The
alternative
is
a
slow
descent
into
transactional
business,
commoditization,
and
ultimately
irrelevance.
The
holistic
wealth
management
firm
is
prepared
to
advocate
for
the
best
interests
of
their
clients.

How
Capital
Markets
Firms
Can
Mitigate
Risk
in
Periods
of
Uncertainty
By
charlotteburgess
Posted

The
following
is
a
sponsored
post
from
Michael
Hom,
Head
of
Financial
Solutions
at
InterSystems,
Gold
Sponsors
of
FinovateFall
Digital
2020
,
September
14
through
18,
2020.
Currently,
external
factors
like
the
COVID-19
pandemic
mean
that
the
global
economy
has
become
increasingly
volatile
and
capital
markets
firms
are
having
to
work
harder
than
ever
to
make
sure
users,
both
retail
and
institutional,
can
continue
to
trade
without
interruption.
As
these
financial
organizations
look
to
mitigate
risk
in
this
period
of
uncertainty,
gaining
operational
resilience,
implementing
risk
mitigation
strategies,
and
having
the
right
technology
in
place
will
be
crucial
to
continue
to
deliver
value
to
customers,
comply
with
regulations,
get
ahead
of
the
competition
–
and,
most
importantly,
maintain
trust.
Given
this,
the
pressure
for
incumbents
to
upgrade
infrastructure
is
only
increasing,
but
challenges
remain
in
doing
so.
While
the
pandemic
may
have
been
the
linchpin
for
organizations
to
start
embracing
new
technologies
there
are
still
barriers
to
overcome
and
best
practices
to
be
put
into
play
to
not
only
mitigate
risk,
but
also
prepare
capital
markets
for
what’s
to
come
in
the
future:
Replacing
legacy
technology
Critical
to
mitigating
risk
is
ensuring
data
is
available
quickly
and
easily
accessible.
For
many
capital
markets
firms
this
is
an
area
where
they
struggle
due
to
a
significant
amount
of
legacy
technology
in
their
infrastructure
and,
consequently,
data
siloes.
Connecting
these
disparate
systems
will
be
vital
to
not
only
help
them
with
performance
issues
they
have
today,
adapting
to
situations
such
as
mass
remote
working,
for
example,
but
also
so
they
are
capable
of
growing
with
them
into
the
future.
This
requires
them
to
adopt
solutions
that
can
seamlessly
run,
scale,
and
expand
into
the
cloud.
By
replacing
legacy
infrastructure,
they
will
have
the
benefit
of
providing
new
technologies
and
innovations
access
to
their
wealth
of
valuable
data.
These
solutions
should
also
be
location
agnostic
to
allow
capital
markets
firms
to
be
agile
and
take
advantage
of
new
technology
and
services
and
bring
that
into
their
existing
infrastructure.
Investment
in
the
future
As
these
institutions
look
to
replace
their
legacy
technology,
they
should
focus
their
investments
on
two
key
areas.
First,
they
should
invest
in
platform
scalability
as
being
able
to
scale
up
as
the
market
spikes
is
crucial
and
can
be
a
major
differentiator.
This
scalability
can
even
give
firms
a
competitive
edge
with
some
firms
having
recently
gained
market
share
solely
due
their
ability
to
scale
up.
The
second
area
of
investment
should
be
in
analytics
and
automation
that
can
support
and,
in
some
cases,
reduce
the
manual-intensive
workload.
We’ve
already
seen
increases
in
algorithmic
trading
and
customer
chatbot
technologies,
while
many
organizations
within
the
financial
services
industry
use
AI
to
automate
processes,
such
as
fraud
checks
and
compliance.
With
less
time
spent
on
time-intensive
manual
tasks,
capital
markets
firms
will
be
able
to
direct
their
attention
to
more
value-adding
services
for
their
clients.
The
use
of
AI
will
help
to
spot
patterns
and
anomalies
in
those
patterns
much
faster
for
fraud
prevention,
while
also
reducing
the
risk
of
human
error.
Gaining
access
to
real-time
data
Is
your
data
strategy
keeping
up
in
real-time?
Within
capital
markets
firms,
there
is
a
growing
requirement
to
be
able
to
access
real-time
data
so
these
organizations
can
simplify
their
stack
and
get
access
to
transactions
that
are
happening
in
the
moment.
This
will
allow
them
to
produce
more
time-sensitive
reporting
so
they
can
make
appropriate
business
decisions
and
better
comply
with
regulatory
requirements.
Data
fabric
Data
fabrics
are
fast
becoming
a
key
trend
within
data
management
across
the
board,
helping
to
reduce
friction.
Improving
the
accuracy,
availability
and
accessibility
of
data
and
should
also
be
a
consideration
as
capital
markets
weather
this
period
of
uncertainty
and
beyond.
A
data
fabric
that
uses
the
latest
technology
will
help
organizations
to
better
grasp
data
governance,
ensure
that
their
data
is
clean
and
accurate,
to
harmonize
that
data
where
appropriate,
and
make
it
more
accessible.
All
of
these
will
help
them
derive
more
value
and
better
insights
from
their
data
to
help
drive
their
enterprises
and
those
of
their
customers
forward.
How
can
capital
markets
firms
not
only
survive,
but
also
thrive?
As
capital
markets
firms
look
beyond
this
period
of
volatility
to
thriving
long
term,
it’s
vital
they
embrace
agility
by
implementing
modern
technology
with
a
focus
on
analytics
and
automation.
This
will
allow
them
to
quickly
adapt
to
changing
and
new
business
needs
by
helping
them
to
make
use
of
their
data,
analyze
it,
monetize
it,
and
turn
it
into
actionable
intelligence.
In
an
increasingly
competitive
landscape,
where
new
market
entrants
aren’t
weighed
down
by
legacy
technology
and
architectures,
this
will
be
a
key
differentiator
and
enable
capital
markets
firms
to
take
advantage
of
new
opportunities
within
the
market
faster.

The
Digitalization
Challenge

The
following
is
a
sponsored
blog
post
by
Chris
Papathanassi,
Global
Solution
Lead,
Lending
with
Finastra.
Papathanassi
discusses
the
two
challenges
facing
lenders:
data
quality
and
ensuring
a
true
&#8220;golden
source&#8221;
and
leveraging
real
value
through
data
connections.
Find

in
the

&gt;&gt;
Today,
digital
is
the
only
way
to
do
business.
But&nbsp;even
though
everything
they
do
can
be
expressed
in&nbsp;ones&nbsp;and&nbsp;zeros,
most
financial
service
organizations
simply
aren’t
set
up
to
be
truly
digital.
In
the
context
of
the
current
disrupted,
volatile
and
remote-working
global
economy,
doing
digital
brilliantly
is
now
a
matter
of
survival
and
urgency
for
many
financial
firms
–
no
longer
simply
a
‘nice
to
have’.&nbsp;
Digital
transformation
is
difficult
for
even
the
simplest
business
models,
and
in
lending
in
particular,&nbsp;there
is
a
real
challenge.&nbsp;When
it
can&nbsp;take
up
to
three
months
to
get
cash
out
of
the
door,&nbsp;it’s
hard
to
see
how
any
bank
can
keep
up
with
the
digital
shift.
There
is
a
continued
dependency
in
lending
on
paper
documentation
and
face-to-face
contact.
Despite
this,
the
challenges
of
digitalization
are
more
than
balanced
out
by
the
potential
benefits.
You&#8217;re
likely
aware
of
a
few
of
these
already: 
Increased
efficiency
–
removing
repetitive,
non-value-added
work&nbsp;and
moving
towards
real-time
processing&nbsp;
Personalization
–
delivering
relevant
customer
service
even
in
a
socially-distanced
context&nbsp;
Improved
credit
management
–
providing
integrated,
rules-based
systems
for
greater
decision
speed
and
transparency&nbsp;
Proactive
risk
management
–
using
APIs
and
platforms
to
“join
up”
the
risk
and
sales
processes
Self-service
for
corporates
&nbsp;–
providing
a
digital
channel
that
empowers
corporate
customers&nbsp;
Unlocking
the
value
of
data
–&nbsp;bringing&nbsp;data
together
from
disparate
sources
so
its
true
value
as
a
commodity
can
be
leveraged
So,
what
needs
to
happen
for
lending
to&nbsp;get
there?
&nbsp;
One
of
the
key
issues
is
data
quality
and
the&nbsp;“golden
source”.&nbsp;&nbsp;The
bespoke
nature
of
lending
makes
it
hard
to
maintain
data
quality
and
consistency.
Lenders
have
their
own
individual
nuances
and
conventions.
And
corporate
borrowers
that
have
lending
relationships
with
many
different
organizations
will
download
and
manipulate
data
so
it’s
in
a
format
they
can&nbsp;work
with.
Can
you
trust
the
data?
As
one
major
bank
asked
us:
“How
can
we
ensure
what
the
source
of
truth
is
across
different
applications?”
What’s
more,
as
data
moves
through
different
systems
in
a
digitalized
and
connected
world,
it
changes
too.&nbsp;&nbsp;
This
points
to
the
second
challenge,
which
is
that
digitalized
lending
data
is
only
valuable
when
it
can be
connected
to the
other
pieces
of
the
puzzle,
to
provide
the
big
picture
lenders
and
borrowers
need.
Right
now,
firms
are
still
downloading
data
into
Excel,
manipulating
it,
and
re-sending
it.
Digitalization
plus
API
capabilities,
however,
makes
it
possible&nbsp;for&nbsp;stakeholders
to
see
the
same
pieces
of
data
in
the
same
state.&nbsp;It’s
this
connectivity
that
is
key
to
realizing
the
full
benefits
of
digitalization
and
addressing
the
“source
of
truth”
issue.&nbsp;
Digitalization
also opens data
to
new
technologies
such
as
AI,
machine
learning,
and
robotic
process
automation,
which
can
create
new
efficiencies
and
value
for
banks
and
customers.
And
for
processes
such
as
syndicated
lending
that
have
multiple
players,
it
can be combined
with
cloud
technology
to
enable
more
collaboration
and
better
access
to
a
single
source
of
truth.
APIs
in
the
cloud
can
make
innovation
more
accessible
to
banks,
overcoming
the
challenges&nbsp;of&nbsp;integrating
in-house
and
external
products.&nbsp;In
essence,
on&nbsp;platforms,
banks
have
access
to
pre-integrated,
interoperable
solutions
and
better
access
to
the
broader
financial
services
ecosystem,
where
they
can
explore
innovations
and
consume
them
at
speed.&nbsp;
This
potentially
changes
the
shape
of
the
lending
industry,&nbsp;opening
up&nbsp;interesting
questions.
What
do
banks
want
to
be?
Leaders
in
the
lending
business
or
providers
of
specialist
products?&nbsp;With
digitalization&nbsp;both
options
are
possible,&nbsp;creating&nbsp;an
opportunity
for
lenders
to&nbsp;add
value
and&nbsp;build
their
lending
businesses&nbsp;–&nbsp;or
to
disintermediate
healthily.&nbsp;

Customer
Knowledge
Augmentation
and
Activation
By

<!--<div

Today
we
feature
a
sponsored
post
from
Celfocus.
Henrique
Cravo
also
sits
down
with
Greg
Palmer
on
the
Finovate
Podcast
to
talk
about
intelligent
use
of
data,
the
importance
of
tailored
experiences,
and
overcoming
barriers
left
by
legacy
systems.
To
get
a
deeper
insight
into
the
topic
register
for
the
webinar:
Delivering
Customer
Knowledge
Augmentation
and
Activation
here
&gt;&gt;
There
aren’t
many
industries
where
organisations
have
so
much
data
about
customers
for
such
a
long
period
of
time.
For
example,
I
have
had
the
same
bank
for
the
last
25
years
which,
by
the
way,
is
the
same
as
my
father’s.
My
bank
has
been
my
partner
when
I
wanted
to
go
to
university
or
buy
my
first
apartment.
It
knows
how
much
I
make
and
where
I
spend
it,
but
I
never
truly
felt
they
used
that
knowledge
to
either
enrich
my
experience
or
deliver
tailored
offers.
Why
is
that?
There
is
a
wealth
of
value
to
explore
in
untapped
customers’
financial
behaviour
and
banks
are
in
prime
position
to
reap
the
benefits,
but
they
need
to
adapt.
The
transformation
has
already
begun
with
banks
introducing
more
channels,
learning
best
practices
from
digital
native
banks
and
fintechs,
and
even
creating
new
digital
business
models
to
test
what
works,
aiming
to
later
integrate
those
learnings
into
the
core
business.
Still,
banks
are
drowning
in
data
and
have
very
little
insight
on
how
to
transform
it
into
actionable
knowledge
to
better
serve
customers,
personalise
offers,
and
deliver
a
consistent
customer
experience.
Furthermore,
through
segmentation,
banks
can
use
their
knowledge
about
current
customers
to
define
campaigns
and
other
initiatives
to
fulfill
one
of
their
main
objectives,
attract
new
customers.
Their
continuous
appetite
for
growth
steams
from
delivering
unique
and
innovative
value
propositions
to
current
but
also
future
customers
which
today
can
be,
in
many
situations,
hallenging.
From
risk
takers,
tech-savvy,
and
hungry
for
innovation
customers
to
techavoiders
that
value
human
touch,
banks
must
accommodate
different
engagement
approaches
and
insights
to
differentiate
customer
profiles.
This
happens
not
because
they
don’t
have
the
data,
but
because
they
can’t
mine
it.
It’s
clear
that
very
soon
‘Customer
intelligence’
will
be
the
most
important
predictor
of
revenue
growth
and
profitability.
The
use
of
behavioural
analytics
will
be
key
to
identify
customer
friction
points
and
there
will
be
a
surge
in
building
technological
capabilities
to
get
more
insight
on
customers’
needs.
A
New
Engagement
Model
for
the
Digital
Age
By
nature,
financial
products
are
complex
and
both
companies
and
individuals
are
deeply
affected
by
their
financial
choices,
so
there’s
a
foreseeable
need
for
contact,
ensuring
a
correct
understanding
of
what
is
at
stake.
Bank
tellers,
financial
advisers,
and
other
resources
are
key
in
accommodating
customers’
requests
and
providing
value-added
and
timely
information.
They
benefit
first-hand
from
customer
insights,
which
enable
them
to
provide
not
only
a
better
service,
but
also
to
increase
the
customer
value
by
offering
the
best
solutions.
In
addition
to
assisted
channels,
there
is
the
emergence
of
self-service
applications
aiming
to
allow
customers
to
engage
on
their
terms,
when
they
want,
going
as
far
as
allowing
customers
to
configure
product
features,
including
pricing.
If,
in
this
case,
the
human
factor
is
eliminated,
the
need
for
accuracy
is
even
greater,
otherwise,
the
sale
may
fail
or
the
inquiry
can
go
unanswered.
Customer
expectations
have
changed
mainly
due
to
the
experience
from
other
digital
native
organisations,
coming
or
not,
from
the
financial
sector.
The
easy
interactions,
the
tailored
offers,
integration
between
physical
and
digital
channels
or
the
unmatched
service,
creates
a
gap
between
what
many
financial
institutions
can
deliver
and
what
customers
are
getting
elsewhere.
Responding
to
the
pressure
to
change,
banks
must
find
a
balance
between
opening
but
guaranteeing
trust
continues
to
be
paramount,
at
all
levels.
Up
to
this
point,
the
perspectives
presented
argued
for
the
need
for
banks
to
not
only
gain
insights
and
knowledge
from
the
data
they
already
have,
but
also
the
challenge
in
adjusting
to
new
customers’
demands
and
how
they
choose
to
engage.
However,
the
biggest
challenge
is
how
to
orchestrate
these
two
dimensions
and
provide
customers
with
experiences
that
leverage
the
knowledge
banks
have
delivered
in
a
seamless
way,
using
whatever
channel
customers
choose
from.
The
holy
grail
of
an
enhanced
experience
in
the
banking
sector
is
to
have
an
holistic
and
end-to-end
perspective
of
the
customer
experience.

Financial
organizations
are
managing
mass
amounts
of
information
on
a
daily
basis.&nbsp;
Whether
it’s
a
loan
application,
credit
approval,
or
new
customer
records,
sharing
documents
securely
is
key
for
effective
task
completion
and
departmental
collaboration.&nbsp;
With
a
variety
of
document
formats
needed
for
each
of
these
tasks,
professionals
must
often
switch
from
application
to
application
to
complete
processes.
Standard
processes
are
often
outdated
and
inefficient.&nbsp;
Discover
how
financial
organizations
can
streamline
their
workflows
and
collaborate
more
effectively
within
their
current
applications.
