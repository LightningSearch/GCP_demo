While 2020 made its mark on the financial industry by causing tremendous disruption, 2021 is shaping up to be a year remembered for transformation and adaptation. Companies are hard at work building new digital strategies that will help them to thrive in an increasingly volatile economy. Fintech developers are taking up the challenge to meet the functionality and performance demands of the financial industry as firms embrace true digital transformation. Their ability to build applications that deliver new features and integrate new capabilities into legacy solutions will be critical for helping firms reshape existing technology infrastructures. Top 5 Fintech Trends to Watch in 2021 1. Customer-First Solutions With so many fintech applications to choose from, financial organizations must take the time to consider which solutions are best suited for the needs of their customers. Banks and investment firms once put their own needs at the center of their processes, but in an increasingly competitive marketplace, they have realized that providing a high-quality user experience is paramount to success. They can begin transforming processes by eliminating friction to allow customers to access the services and products they need more quickly. Fintech developers can help them to eliminate manual processes, reduce external dependencies, and automate common tasks by designing unified digital solutions that address multiple challenges and streamline workflows. By integrating features like document viewing, file conversion, and form data capture into their applications, innovative developers are finding ways to strengthen the connection between firms and their customers. 2. Enhancing Digital Collaboration In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, much of the financial industry has embraced remote work arrangements for the foreseeable future. The transition has created significant demand for digital tools that can facilitate effective and secure collaboration. Not only must physical documents be converted into digital form, but firms also need ways to make those files available to remote employees without threatening data security or causing version confusion. Organizations frequently turn to a variety of incompatible software solutions and improvised workarounds to meet their viewing, editing, and document management needs rather than implementing a dedicated, all-in-one solution. Unfortunately, these ad hoc measures create inefficient third-party dependencies, expose data to unnecessary risk, and make human error more likely. Fintech developers can integrate these features into a single application through the use of SDKs and web-based APIs. 3. Managing Big Data Financial services firms gather massive quantities of data on a regular basis. Although much of that data is unstructured and needs to be filtered through sophisticated algorithms to bring notable trends and risks to the forefront, the industry also collects a great deal of data from structured forms . Structured documents such as loan applications, tax filings, and financial statements all provide valuable data insights that organizations can use to make more informed strategic decisions. Fintech applications with the ability to extract and process data from structured forms accurately is essential for improving the performance of powerful analytics tools deployed by today’s financial firms. Software integrations can further enhance fintech solutions with image cleanup, document alignment, and form recognition features that make the data collection process more efficient and accurate. 4. Disaster Mitigation After seeing how the COVID-19 pandemic caused massive disruption to global markets and supply chains, financial organizations are reviewing the way they do business to reduce the impact of similar disasters in the future. One of the key steps in this process will be the rapid transition to paperless workflows and an expansion of electronic data capture capabilities to reduce the reliance upon manual processes. Solutions that incorporate streamlined document viewing, file conversion capabilities, and data extraction tools will be essential to these “disaster proofing” efforts. By automating previously manual tasks, such as data entry, document assembly, and signature authentication, Fintech solutions can help financial companies protect their business processes from future disruptions. 5. Expanded Partnership Opportunities Although traditional financial institutions like banks have been skeptical of many fintech solutions, the rapidly-changing market has caused them to reassess their technology in order to reach a new generation of customers. Collaboration between banks and innovative fintech startups was already on the rise before the pandemic reduced longstanding barriers to digital transformation. The challenge they now face is how to integrate their operations and data while also launching innovative services across multiple channels. Fintech developers can streamline this process by building flexible software applications capable of handling a variety of file formats without the need for any burdensome third-party dependencies. In some cases, that may mean building entirely new solutions, while in others it might call for integrating additional features into firmly entrenched legacy applications. The fintech companies with the ability to get innovative software platforms to market more quickly will be able to make the most of their partnership opportunities.

The COVID-19 crisis has thrown a spotlight on the inefficiencies underlying many functional areas of financial firms and caused executives to reevaluate operational resilience in light of increasing volumes and volatility. There’s been a lot of industry discussion about the potential of Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to tackle challenges ranging from regulatory change management to improving the client experience. AI has huge potential to augment and transform current market practices, but organizations need to make sure they are laying the groundwork for successful implementation by considering the underlying data infrastructure required to turn these technology ambitions into reality. In this white paper, Firebrand Research discusses how to tackle the complex issue of data management and shares key reasons to invest in a smart data fabric, including: Building the data foundation for next-generation initiatives Enabling a firm to adapt to volatile markets via real-time analytics Connecting and harmonizing data on demand from across a firm’s many silos Keeping firms out of the regulatory hot seat by ensuring high data quality Providing accurate and real-time insights and new innovative services to keep ahead of the competition Read the full whitepaper here &gt;&gt; Share this: Send Post Twitter LinkedIn Facebook Puerto Rico: An Attractive Location for Startups &amp; Established Tech Companies By charlotteburgess Posted on December 17, 2020 Categories: Finovate Global , Sponsored <!--<div class="sharing"> --> The below is a sponsored post by FinovateFall Digital exhibitor, Invest Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico is poised to become the global model for how to roll out cutting-edge tools that enable blockchain, AI, and the Internet of Things (IoT). All of these technologies are designed to transform nearly every sector, notably financial services, bioscience, and aerospace. Technology represents the changes imminent in the 4th industrial revolution. Proper implementation and growth of these tools has been a critical priority contributing to the island’s economic diversity, development, and competitiveness. Network Advances in these fields would not be possible without a supportive Information &amp; Communications Technology (ICT) network. As an island, Puerto Rico depends on its ability to communicate with the world to do business. As such, companies benefit from extensive island-wide 5G, broadband access, established LoRa network capabilities, and broad satellite connections. Every element of this network ensures producers are connected to suppliers, customers, and business partners. Puerto Rico’s tech expertise and nationally unique international banking policies—along with the growing demand for effective financial solutions and resources—has led to a boom in innovative fintech and investing services that extend to every industry.

Digital transformation has been on the radar of most financial institutions for years. In a 2020 Digital Transformation Survey by BDO of financial services professionals, 68% of respondents in 2019 saw a growth in revenue directly related to digital investments. While many have made digital transformation a priority, some have faced roadblocks including risk-aversion and lack of corporate sponsorship. With COVID-19 sweeping the globe, priorities are shifting, emphasizing the need for digital transformation.&nbsp; As noted in a state of the industry report authored by the Institute of International Finance and Deloitte , “COVID-19 has generated leadership and organizational support by highlighting the need for digital transformation as a means to reach customers and maintain operational resilience.” Of those surveyed by BDO prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, 36% see industry disruption as the primary digital threat. In addition, a recent survey by IDG Research states that 59% of respondents are seeing an acceleration of digital transformation in their companies driven by the pandemic. Now that implementing the digital strategy has taken center stage on the fintech roadmap, developers are looking to meet the needs of leadership as well as customers and employees in a timely and budget efficient manner. What Is Digital Transformation? The name digital transformation embodies a wide assortment of initiatives, from the customer engagement experience to transforming legacy systems. In an article by The Financial Brand , financial executives were asked to select their top digital transformation priorities for 2021. Out of the long list of initiatives, four of the highest priorities are: Improve Customer Experience Improve Use of Data, Analytics, and AI Enhance Innovation Agility Improve Back Office Efficiency Financial institutions are prioritizing several diverse initiatives to remain relevant during the global pandemic. Project managers need to shorten development time, meet executive mandates, and launch products that significantly improve the employee and customer experience. SDK and API Integrations Streamline Fintech Development Development teams can effectively meet those timelines by partnering with software manufacturers who build and maintain software development kits (SDKs) and application programming interfaces (APIs). Developers can integrate these SDKs and APIs into their product offerings to add unique document processing capabilities. By partnering with a high-tech software solution, your team can save development time, shorten sprints, and reduce maintenance cost. While these are significant benefits, partnering and integrating third-party software manufacturers come with many advantages, including the ability to: Remove the burden of building and maintaining extensive document processing libraries Access the manufacturer’s support and engineering team who can assist with implementation and resolve issues Significantly reduce time to market of your product Let’s take a deeper look at each of these advantages. Integrate vs. Build &amp; Maintain Document Processing Libraries &#8211; Consider how many different file formats are available in the market for submitting data to financial institutions.  Fintech users receive everything from Word documents to PDFs to images taken with cell phones. All of those file formats need to be taken into consideration when building a fintech application that streamlines the process of capturing data from those files. Building out libraries of code that can address every possible option is extremely cumbersome and time-consuming.  However, developers can leverage an SDK or API that has been developed specifically for document processing and open up time to focus on their core competencies. Access to Support and Engineering Experts &#8211; When financial institutions embed third-party document and image processing solutions, they are also gaining access to a team of experts. At Accusoft, each customer has access to technical support and product developers that have helped hundreds of companies with implementing and utilizing these document processing SDKs and APIs. Digital transformation is a pressing concern for financial organizations. You can help them meet their needs with our SDKs and APIs. Get this new functionality up and running quickly in your application so your developers can focus on more mission-critical tasks. Reduce Time to Market &#8211; As noted in the report by BDO, “Most financial services companies anticipate high returns on revenue and profitability from digital transformation.” Project managers that prioritize research and implement third-party software solutions can significantly reduce the time to market. This, in turn, will allow their company to realize profits faster than their competition. With the recent changes in the world, the need for digital transformation is not slowing down.&nbsp;&nbsp; Financial institutions that prioritize those initiatives and research ways to develop and implement their new offerings quickly will be ahead in realizing revenues and returning profits to shareholders.

In an increasingly digital world filled with chatbots, tap-and-go payments, and “buy now, pay later” credit lines,&nbsp; hyper-personalization &nbsp;is the new frontier on top of a new frontier in financial services. What is hyper-personalization? Hyper-personalization enables financial services organizations to leverage the huge volumes of&nbsp; customer data &nbsp;they have in their systems efficiently and effectively to make more specific and more relevant product recommendations, such as an increase of a credit limit at the point of sale, or a list of previous interactions pushed to the chatbot, allowing it to pick up where it last left off. It does so by analyzing the data available to it through the power of analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning. It offers immense growth opportunities for all financial services providers if they can cater to small and specific groups. Hyper-personalization can foster loyalty in an era in which loyalty has declined, and it pushes the next generation of consumers and investors towards those financial services which can be agile in what they offer. Traditional firms and hyper-personalization Traditional firms are often encumbered by processes built up over decades. These processes are ingrained and necessary for them to have operated the way they have successfully and for so long. To these firms, those same processes hinder the uptake of advances such as AI, data analytics and machine learning. Yet these and other new technologies do not require traditional firms to re-imagine how processes work, nor does implementing have to be as obtrusive and disruptive as a full digital transformation initiative, for example. Rather, technology can be implemented in the background and effectively manage itself, be installed quickly and efficiently in existing systems without disrupting the rest of the business. Some can even run adjacently to everything else the business does. Traditional firms have decades or more worth of data. Analytics tools, AI, and machine learning work together to make sense of it all, wherever it might be and in whatever language it might be in, and surface actionable insights from all of it. Importantly, these technologies work in the background, without disrupting any mission-critical processes. How can traditional firms hyper-personalize? Traditional firms can deploy a&nbsp; smart &nbsp; data fabric , which is effectively a layer which sits above all of the firm’s available endpoints and distributed services — whether it be in the&nbsp; cloud, on-premise or both &nbsp;— and ensures those endpoints and their capabilities speak the same language. Next, the data needs to be put through proper governance procedures to ensure it is clean, relevant and has the necessary integrity to be used with confidence for the right reasons by the organization — it needs to be accurate, reliable, complete, appropriate, and credible. For this to occur, it goes through something of a digital centrifuge which analyses its health and cleans it before having it ready for primetime. Once this is done, the rich streams of data inherent across the company can be mined, analyzed, and surfaced using the power of AI and machine learning. This may sound like a lot of steps and go against the grain of what we’ve been discussing in this article. But rest assured, all of these technologies can be implemented with little to no disruption to operations, and they work in the background while delivering key insights for the data almost in real-time. It’s through using these technologies that traditional firms can, at last, unlock those rich and extensive streams of historical data dating back decades, which in turn provides a clear method to fostering loyalty. Research shows that customers want a hyper-personalized experience. According to Accenture,&nbsp; 91 percent of consumers &nbsp;are more likely to shop with brands who recognize them, remember them, and provide them with relevant offers and recommendations. Conclusion Traditional firms have a hyper-personalization advantage thanks to possessing a trove of legacy data and brand recognition. They just need to embrace what is available to help leverage their data and analytics to get them to their intelligent future — and trust that it can and will co-exist with existing processes. If they allow technology to do the heavy lifting for them alongside their existing processes, traditional firms will be able to leverage decades of data to their advantage and engage in new ways with customers, without having to re-invent the wheel.

Hamblin explores why success will come down to understanding and empathizing with your client . Dig a little deeper into this topic with Microsoft&#8217;s eBook on the topic: Reimagine the client experience in wealth management . COVID-19 has put a strain on everyone. We’ve all navigated social isolation, uncertain investment projections, and remote work environments. Regardless of the experience, this time away has left a haze over individuals and organizations alike. We’re not just unsure what comes next, we’re questioning the very processes we’ve accepted to this point. Investors are feeling a new tension that makes small pain points all the more obvious. Voice automation, fixed fees, commissions — what clients once accepted as the cost of doing business are suddenly under intense scrutiny. Clients aren’t obligated to trust a major firm with their financial future, and now they’re acting on the opportunity to move their money elsewhere. So how can wealth management firms adapt their strategies (and identities) to regain that trust? It all starts with understanding the client. A holistic experience Over the years, many wealth firms operated under a one-size-fits-most model — if the client fell into a specific demographic, then the firm provided a specific portfolio. Empowered by the Digital Age and amplified by this pandemic, a growing number of modern clients are looking for a wealth management partner—someone willing to listen to their ambitions, dreams, and goals and recommend actions catered to their unique circumstances. These clients want to feel identified, seen, and valued; they want to feel like more than an account number. Organizations can deliver on that expectation by creating a holistic client experience — a strategic client approach that uses technology and relationship-building to create a more inclusive perspective on the client’s needs, interests, and ambitions. Delivering a holistic client experience comes to life in three ways: portfolios, services, and communications. Holistic portfolios &nbsp;understand the client’s dreams, goals, and life events and work to build the right mix of investments to meet that individual’s financial plan, risk preference, and goals. By moving away from cookie-cutter portfolios and embracing a consultative approach, advisors create a partnership built on trust. Holistic services &nbsp;encourage firms to expand their capabilities to adapt to a changing world. In the last decade, clients have become jaded by fixed-fee models. At the same time, online resources have made wealth management more accessible. By shifting to a holistic client model, organizations expand their services beyond portfolio management and provide added-value services like financial advice and planning, risk mitigation, goal tracking, wealth building strategies, and even bring in experts for specialized areas like real estate, education planning, tax mitigation, and estate planning. By expanding into capabilities that they may not have focused on before, wealth management firms further align with the individual goals of their clients and can offer one-stop solutions. Likewise,&nbsp; holistic communication &nbsp;leverages the client’s communication preference. Every company has multiple engagement channels—voice, text, email, chat, video, social media, etc.—but most organizations assume that every client wants to be contacted via every channel. Yet, modern tools can equip firms to democratize their client data to share information and insights. By consolidating data and communication streams into a single hub of truth and by providing that information via client-friendly channels, wealth management firms can ensure that clients are engaged in the mediums they prefer. Adapting in real time It won&#8217;t be enough to lag behind your clients, real time adaptations and analysis will count. While holistic client experiences serve as the star of wealth management’s future, next-generation technologies will be the foundation of these efforts. Trending tools like AI, life event and goal tracking, market risk analysis, smart portfolio allocation, and project automation equip organizations with the tools they need to build more responsive, reliable offerings for clients. Imagine how predictive analytic tools will help determine the stability of future investments or the time employees could save on data entry through automation. Today’s technologies grant employees the tools they need to deliver a holistic customer experience by making their day-to-day tasks more efficient and effective. Investing in trust By creating a holistic client experience, wealth management firms become a reliable asset during hardship and a celebrated ally in victories. Right now, clients around the world are reassessing their investments for fear of a future crisis. In many cases, COVID-19 has fundamentally upset the way many clients view wealth management and building. It’s up to firms to empathize with those concerns and shape their efforts to bring peace of mind. With a multitude of wealth firms fighting for their dollars, today’s clients are increasingly taking their funds to firms that demonstrate a conscious effort to understand their ambitions beyond executing trades. Wealth management firms that position themselves as true advisors and champion the hopes and dreams of their clients can foster trusting and long-lasting relationships. The alternative is a slow descent into transactional business, commoditization, and ultimately irrelevance. The holistic wealth management firm is prepared to advocate for the best interests of their clients.

Currently, external factors like the COVID-19 pandemic mean that the global economy has become increasingly volatile and capital markets firms are having to work harder than ever to make sure users, both retail and institutional, can continue to trade without interruption. As these financial organizations look to mitigate risk in this period of uncertainty, gaining operational resilience, implementing risk mitigation strategies, and having the right technology in place will be crucial to continue to deliver value to customers, comply with regulations, get ahead of the competition – and, most importantly, maintain trust. Given this, the pressure for incumbents to upgrade infrastructure is only increasing, but challenges remain in doing so. While the pandemic may have been the linchpin for organizations to start embracing new technologies there are still barriers to overcome and best practices to be put into play to not only mitigate risk, but also prepare capital markets for what’s to come in the future: Replacing legacy technology Critical to mitigating risk is ensuring data is available quickly and easily accessible. For many capital markets firms this is an area where they struggle due to a significant amount of legacy technology in their infrastructure and, consequently, data siloes. Connecting these disparate systems will be vital to not only help them with performance issues they have today, adapting to situations such as mass remote working, for example, but also so they are capable of growing with them into the future. This requires them to adopt solutions that can seamlessly run, scale, and expand into the cloud. By replacing legacy infrastructure, they will have the benefit of providing new technologies and innovations access to their wealth of valuable data. These solutions should also be location agnostic to allow capital markets firms to be agile and take advantage of new technology and services and bring that into their existing infrastructure. Investment in the future As these institutions look to replace their legacy technology, they should focus their investments on two key areas. First, they should invest in platform scalability as being able to scale up as the market spikes is crucial and can be a major differentiator. This scalability can even give firms a competitive edge with some firms having recently gained market share solely due their ability to scale up. The second area of investment should be in analytics and automation that can support and, in some cases, reduce the manual-intensive workload. We’ve already seen increases in algorithmic trading and customer chatbot technologies, while many organizations within the financial services industry use AI to automate processes, such as fraud checks and compliance. With less time spent on time-intensive manual tasks, capital markets firms will be able to direct their attention to more value-adding services for their clients. The use of AI will help to spot patterns and anomalies in those patterns much faster for fraud prevention, while also reducing the risk of human error. Gaining access to real-time data Is your data strategy keeping up in real-time? Within capital markets firms, there is a growing requirement to be able to access real-time data so these organizations can simplify their stack and get access to transactions that are happening in the moment. This will allow them to produce more time-sensitive reporting so they can make appropriate business decisions and better comply with regulatory requirements. Data fabric Data fabrics are fast becoming a key trend within data management across the board, helping to reduce friction. Improving the accuracy, availability and accessibility of data and should also be a consideration as capital markets weather this period of uncertainty and beyond. A data fabric that uses the latest technology will help organizations to better grasp data governance, ensure that their data is clean and accurate, to harmonize that data where appropriate, and make it more accessible. All of these will help them derive more value and better insights from their data to help drive their enterprises and those of their customers forward. How can capital markets firms not only survive, but also thrive? As capital markets firms look beyond this period of volatility to thriving long term, it’s vital they embrace agility by implementing modern technology with a focus on analytics and automation. This will allow them to quickly adapt to changing and new business needs by helping them to make use of their data, analyze it, monetize it, and turn it into actionable intelligence. In an increasingly competitive landscape, where new market entrants aren’t weighed down by legacy technology and architectures, this will be a key differentiator and enable capital markets firms to take advantage of new opportunities within the market faster.

Papathanassi discusses the two challenges facing lenders: data quality and ensuring a true &#8220;golden source&#8221; and leveraging real value through data connections. Find out more in the full report &gt;&gt; Today, digital is the only way to do business. But&nbsp;even though everything they do can be expressed in&nbsp;ones&nbsp;and&nbsp;zeros, most financial service organizations simply aren’t set up to be truly digital. In the context of the current disrupted, volatile and remote-working global economy, doing digital brilliantly is now a matter of survival and urgency for many financial firms – no longer simply a ‘nice to have’.&nbsp; Digital transformation is difficult for even the simplest business models, and in lending in particular,&nbsp;there is a real challenge.&nbsp;When it can&nbsp;take up to three months to get cash out of the door,&nbsp;it’s hard to see how any bank can keep up with the digital shift. There is a continued dependency in lending on paper documentation and face-to-face contact. Despite this, the challenges of digitalization are more than balanced out by the potential benefits. You&#8217;re likely aware of a few of these already:  Increased efficiency – removing repetitive, non-value-added work&nbsp;and moving towards real-time processing&nbsp; Personalization – delivering relevant customer service even in a socially-distanced context&nbsp; Improved credit management – providing integrated, rules-based systems for greater decision speed and transparency&nbsp; Proactive risk management – using APIs and platforms to “join up” the risk and sales processes Self-service for corporates &nbsp;– providing a digital channel that empowers corporate customers&nbsp; Unlocking the value of data –&nbsp;bringing&nbsp;data together from disparate sources so its true value as a commodity can be leveraged So, what needs to happen for lending to&nbsp;get there? &nbsp; One of the key issues is data quality and the&nbsp;“golden source”.&nbsp;&nbsp;The bespoke nature of lending makes it hard to maintain data quality and consistency. Lenders have their own individual nuances and conventions. And corporate borrowers that have lending relationships with many different organizations will download and manipulate data so it’s in a format they can&nbsp;work with. Can you trust the data? As one major bank asked us: “How can we ensure what the source of truth is across different applications?” What’s more, as data moves through different systems in a digitalized and connected world, it changes too.&nbsp;&nbsp; This points to the second challenge, which is that digitalized lending data is only valuable when it can be connected to the other pieces of the puzzle, to provide the big picture lenders and borrowers need. Right now, firms are still downloading data into Excel, manipulating it, and re-sending it. Digitalization plus API capabilities, however, makes it possible&nbsp;for&nbsp;stakeholders to see the same pieces of data in the same state.&nbsp;It’s this connectivity that is key to realizing the full benefits of digitalization and addressing the “source of truth” issue.&nbsp; Digitalization also opens data to new technologies such as AI, machine learning, and robotic process automation, which can create new efficiencies and value for banks and customers. And for processes such as syndicated lending that have multiple players, it can be combined with cloud technology to enable more collaboration and better access to a single source of truth. APIs in the cloud can make innovation more accessible to banks, overcoming the challenges&nbsp;of&nbsp;integrating in-house and external products.&nbsp;In essence, on&nbsp;platforms, banks have access to pre-integrated, interoperable solutions and better access to the broader financial services ecosystem, where they can explore innovations and consume them at speed.&nbsp; This potentially changes the shape of the lending industry,&nbsp;opening up&nbsp;interesting questions. What do banks want to be? Leaders in the lending business or providers of specialist products?&nbsp;With digitalization&nbsp;both options are possible,&nbsp;creating&nbsp;an opportunity for lenders to&nbsp;add value and&nbsp;build their lending businesses&nbsp;–&nbsp;or to disintermediate healthily.&nbsp; Interested in learning more?

Henrique Cravo also sits down with Greg Palmer on the Finovate Podcast to talk about intelligent use of data, the importance of tailored experiences, and overcoming barriers left by legacy systems. To get a deeper insight into the topic register for the webinar: Delivering Customer Knowledge Augmentation and Activation here &gt;&gt; There aren’t many industries where organisations have so much data about customers for such a long period of time. For example, I have had the same bank for the last 25 years which, by the way, is the same as my father’s. My bank has been my partner when I wanted to go to university or buy my first apartment. It knows how much I make and where I spend it, but I never truly felt they used that knowledge to either enrich my experience or deliver tailored offers. Why is that? There is a wealth of value to explore in untapped customers’ financial behaviour and banks are in prime position to reap the benefits, but they need to adapt. The transformation has already begun with banks introducing more channels, learning best practices from digital native banks and fintechs, and even creating new digital business models to test what works, aiming to later integrate those learnings into the core business. Still, banks are drowning in data and have very little insight on how to transform it into actionable knowledge to better serve customers, personalise offers, and deliver a consistent customer experience. Furthermore, through segmentation, banks can use their knowledge about current customers to define campaigns and other initiatives to fulfill one of their main objectives, attract new customers. Their continuous appetite for growth steams from delivering unique and innovative value propositions to current but also future customers which today can be, in many situations, hallenging. From risk takers, tech-savvy, and hungry for innovation customers to techavoiders that value human touch, banks must accommodate different engagement approaches and insights to differentiate customer profiles. This happens not because they don’t have the data, but because they can’t mine it. It’s clear that very soon ‘Customer intelligence’ will be the most important predictor of revenue growth and profitability. The use of behavioural analytics will be key to identify customer friction points and there will be a surge in building technological capabilities to get more insight on customers’ needs. A New Engagement Model for the Digital Age By nature, financial products are complex and both companies and individuals are deeply affected by their financial choices, so there’s a foreseeable need for contact, ensuring a correct understanding of what is at stake. Bank tellers, financial advisers, and other resources are key in accommodating customers’ requests and providing value-added and timely information. They benefit first-hand from customer insights, which enable them to provide not only a better service, but also to increase the customer value by offering the best solutions. In addition to assisted channels, there is the emergence of self-service applications aiming to allow customers to engage on their terms, when they want, going as far as allowing customers to configure product features, including pricing. If, in this case, the human factor is eliminated, the need for accuracy is even greater, otherwise, the sale may fail or the inquiry can go unanswered. Customer expectations have changed mainly due to the experience from other digital native organisations, coming or not, from the financial sector. The easy interactions, the tailored offers, integration between physical and digital channels or the unmatched service, creates a gap between what many financial institutions can deliver and what customers are getting elsewhere. Responding to the pressure to change, banks must find a balance between opening but guaranteeing trust continues to be paramount, at all levels. Up to this point, the perspectives presented argued for the need for banks to not only gain insights and knowledge from the data they already have, but also the challenge in adjusting to new customers’ demands and how they choose to engage. However, the biggest challenge is how to orchestrate these two dimensions and provide customers with experiences that leverage the knowledge banks have delivered in a seamless way, using whatever channel customers choose from. The holy grail of an enhanced experience in the banking sector is to have an holistic and end-to-end perspective of the customer experience. Introducing Celfocus Customer Knowledge Augmentation and Activation Celfocus Customer Knowledge Augmentation and Activation is a modular and integrated framework tailored to leverage banks’ customer knowledge and deliver tailored services. This framework is anchored in 2 main modules. The first comprises the tools and technologies to augment customer knowledge by activating every single customer through automated AI and Cognitive data insights, and the second aims at delivering tailored experiences that trigger new targets, portfolios, and customer lock. By encompassing the Customer Value Augmentation and Enhance Customer Experience modules, the solution provides banks’ full control of the customer journey from planning to execution, focusing on building the technology capabilities to get more intelligence about customers’ needs, and how to best serve them.
