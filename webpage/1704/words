As
technology
advances,
things
don’t
always
become
bigger
and
better,
objects
also
become
smaller.
In
fact,
nanotechnology
is
one
of
the
fastest-growing
technological
fields,
worth
over
1
trillion
USD,
and
it’s
forecast
to
grow
by
approximately
17%
over
the
next
half-decade.
Nanobots
are
a
major
part
of
the
nanotechnology
field,
but
what
are
they
exactly
and
how
do
they
operate?
Let’s
take
a
closer
look
at
nanobots
to
understand
how
this
transformative
technology
works
and
what
it’s
used
for.
What
Are
Nanobots?
The
field
of
nanotechnology
is
concerned
with
the
research
and
development
of
technology
approximately
one
to
100
nanometres
in
scale.
Therefore,
nanorobotics
is
focused
on
the
creation
of
robots
that
are
around
this
size.
In
practice,
it’s
difficult
to
engineer
anything
as
small
as
one
nanometer
in
scale
and
the
term
“nanorobotics”
and
“nanobot”
is
frequently
applied
to
devices
which
are
approximately
0.1
&#8211;
10
micrometers
in
size,
which
is
still
quite
small.
It’s
important
to
note
that
the
term
“nanorobot”
is
sometimes
applied
to
devices
which
interact
with
objects
at
the
nanoscale,
manipulating
nanoscale
items.
Therefore,
even
if
the
device
itself
is
much
larger,
it
may
be
considered
a
nanorobotic
instrument.
This
article
will
focus
on
nanoscale
robots
themselves.
Much
of
the
field
of
nanorobotics
and
nanobots
is
still
in
the
theoretical
phase,
with
research
focused
on
solving
the
problems
of
construction
at
such
a
small
scale.
However,
some
prototype
nanomachines
and
nanomotors
have
been
designed
and
tested.
Most
currently
existing
nanorobotic
devices
fall
into
one
of
four
categories
:
switches,
motors,
shuttles,
and
cars.
Nanorobotic
switches
operate
by
being
prompted
to
switch
from
an
“off”
state
to
an
“on”
state.
Environmental
factors
are
used
to
make
the
machine
change
shape,
a
process
called
conformational
change.
The
environment
is
altered
using
processes
like
chemical
reactions,
UV
light,
and
temperature,
and
the
nanorobotic
switches
shift
into
different
forms
as
a
result,
able
to
accomplish
specific
tasks.
Nanomotors
are
more
complex
than
simple
switches,
and
they
utilize
the
energy
created
by
the
effects
of
the
conformational
change
in
order
to
move
around
and
affect
the
molecules
in
the
surrounding
environment.
Shuttles
are
nanorobots
that
are
capable
of
transporting
chemicals
like
drugs
to
specific,
targeted
regions.
The
goal
is
to
combine
shuttles
with
nanorobot
motors
so
that
the
shuttles
are
capable
of
a
greater
degree
of
movement
through
an
environment.
Nanorobotic
“cars”
are
the
most
advanced
nanodevices
at
the
moment,
capable
of
moving
independently
with
prompts
from
chemical
or
electromagnetic
catalysts.
The
nanomotors
that
drive
nanorobotic
cars
need
to
be
controlled
in
order
for
the
vehicle
to
be
steered,
and
researchers
are
experimenting
with
various
methods
of
nanorobotic
control.
Nanorobotics
researchers
aim
to
synthesize
these
different
components
and
technologies
into
nanomachines
that
can
complete
complex
tasks,
accomplished
by
swarms
of
nanobots
working
together.

How
Are
Nanobots
Created?
The
field
of
nanorobotics
is
at
the
crossroads
of
many
disciplines
and
the
creation
of
nanobots
involves
the
creation
of
sensors,
actuators
and
motors.
Physical
modeling
must
be
done
as
well,
and
all
of
this
must
be
done
at
nanoscale.
As
mentioned
above,
nanomanipulation
devices
are
used
to
assemble
these
nano-scale
parts
and
manipulate
artificial
or
biological
components,
which
includes
the
manipulation
of
cells
and
molecules.
Nanorobotics
engineers
must
be
able
to
solve
a
multitude
of
problems.
They
have
to
address
issues
regarding
sensation,
control
power,
communications,
and
interactions
between
both
inorganic
and
organic
materials.
The
size
of
a
nanobot
is
roughly
comparable
to
biological
cells,
and
because
of
this
fact
future
nanobots
could
be
employed
in
disciplines
like
medicine
and
environmental
preservation/remediation.
Most
“nanobots”
that
exist
today
are
just
specific
molecules
which
have
been
manipulated
to
accomplish
certain
tasks.
 
Complex
nanobots
are
essentially
just
simple
molecules
joined
together
and
manipulated
with
chemical
processes.
For
instance,
some
nanobots
are
comprised
of
DNA
,
and
they
transport
molecular
cargo.
How
Do
Nanobots
Operate?
Given
the
still
heavily
theoretical
nature
of
nanobots,
questions
about
how
nanobots
operate
are
answered
with
predictions
rather
than
statements
of
fact.
It’s
likely
that
the
first
major
uses
for
nanobots
will
be
in
the
medical
field,
moving
through
the
human
body
and
accomplishing
tasks
like
diagnosing
diseases,
monitoring
vitals,
and
dispensing
treatments.
These
nanobots
will
need
to
be
able
to
navigate
their
way
around
the
human
body
and
move
through
tissues
like
blood
vessels.
Navigation
In
terms
of
nanobot
navigation,
there
are
a
variety
of
techniques
that
nanobot
researchers
and
engineers
are
investigating.
One
method
of
navigation
is
the
utilization
of
ultrasonic
signals
for
detection
and
deployment.
A
nanobot
could
emit
ultrasonic
signals
that
could
be
traced
to
locate
the
position
of
the
nanobots,
and
the
robots
could
then
be
guided
to
specific
areas
with
the
use
of
a
special
tool
that
directs
their
motion.
Magnetic
Resonance
Imaging
(MRI)
devices
could
also
be
employed
to
track
the
position
of
nanobots,
and
early
experiments
with
MRIs
have
demonstrated
that
the
technology
can
be
used
to
detect
and
even
maneuver
nanobots.
Other
methods
of
detecting
and
maneuvring
nanobots
include
the
use
of
X-rays,
microwaves
and
radio-waves.
At
the
moment,
our
control
of
these
waves
at
the
nano-scale
is
fairly
limited,
so
new
methods
of
utilizing
these
waves
would
have
to
be
invented.
The
navigation
and
detection
systems
described
above
are
external
methods,
relying
on
the
use
of
tools
to
move
the
nanobots.
With
the
addition
of
onboard
sensors,
the
nanobots
could
be
more
autonomous.
For
instance,
chemical
sensors
included
onboard
nanobots
could
allow
the
robot
to
scan
the
surrounding
environment
and
follow
certain
chemical
markers
to
a
target
region.
Power
When
it
comes
to
powering
the
nanobots,
there
are
also
a
variety
of
power
solutions
being
explored
by
researchers.
Solutions
for
powering
nanobots
include
external
power
sources
and
onboard/internal
power
sources.
Internal
power
solutions
include
generators
and
capacitors.
Generators
onboard
the
nanobot
could
use
the
electrolytes
found
within
the
blood
to
produce
energy,
or
nanobots
could
even
be
powered
using
the
surrounding
blood
as
a
chemical
catalyst
that
produces
energy
when
combined
with
a
chemical
the
nanobot
carries
with
it.
Capacitors
operate
similarly
to
batteries,
storing
electrical
energy
that
could
be
used
to
propel
the
nanobot.
Other
options
like
tiny
nuclear
power
sources
have
even
been
considered.
As
far
as
external
power
sources
go,
incredibly
small,
thin
wires
could
tether
the
nanobots
to
an
outside
power
source.
Such
wires
could
be
made
out
of
miniature
fiber
optic
cables,
sending
pulses
of
light
down
the
wires
and
having
the
actual
electricity
be
generated
within
the
nanobot.
Other
external
power
solutions
include
magnetic
fields
or
ultrasonic
signals.
Nanobots
could
employ
something
called
a
piezoelectric
membrane,
which
is
capable
of
collecting
ultrasonic
waves
and
transforming
them
into
electrical
power.
Magnetic
fields
can
be
used
to
catalyze
electrical
currents
within
a
closed
conducting
loop
contained
onboard
the
nanobot.
As
a
bonus,
the
magnetic
field
could
also
be
used
to
control
the
direction
of
the
nanobot.
Locomotion
Addressing
the
problem
of
nanobot
locomotion
requires
some
inventive
solutions.
Nanobots
that
aren’t
tethered,
or
aren’t
just
free-floating
in
their
environment,
need
to
have
some
method
of
moving
to
their
target
locations.
The
propulsion
system
will
need
to
be
powerful
and
stable,
able
to
propel
the
nanobot
against
currents
in
its
surrounding
environment,
like
the
flow
of
the
blood.
Propulsion
solutions
under
investigation
are
often
inspired
by
the
natural
world,
with
researchers
looking
at
how
microscope
organisms
move
through
their
environment.
For
instance,
microorganisms
often
use
long,
whip-like
tails
called
flagella
to
propel
themselves,
or
they
use
a
number
of
tiny,
hair-like
limbs
dubbed
cilia.
Researchers
are
also
experimenting
with
giving
robots
small
arm-like
appendages
that
could
allow
the
robot
to
swim,
grip,
and
crawl.
Currently,
these
appendages
are
controlled
via
magnetic
fields
outside
the
body,
as
the
magnetic
force
prompts
the
robot’s
arms
to
vibrate.
An
added
benefit
to
this
method
of
locomotion
is
that
the
energy
for
it
comes
from
an
outside
source.
This
technology
would
need
to
be
made
even
smaller
to
make
it
viable
for
true
nanobots.
There
are
other,
more
inventive,
propulsion
strategies
also
under
investigation.
For
instance,
some
researchers
have
proposed
using
capacitors
to
engineer
an
electromagnetic
pump
that
would
pull
conductive
fluids
in
and
shoot
it
out
like
a
jet
,
propelling
the
nanobot
forward.
Regardless
of
the
eventual
application
of
nanobots,
they
must
solve
the
problems
described
above,
handling
navigation,
locomotion,
and
power.
What
Are
Nanobots
Used
For?
As
mentioned,
the
first
uses
for
nanobots
will
likely
be
in
the
medical
field
.
Nanobots
could
be
used
to
monitor
for
damage
to
the
body,
and
potentially
even
facilitate
the
repair
of
this
damage.
Future
nanobots
could
deliver
medicine
directly
to
the
cells
that
need
them.
Currently,
medicines
are
delivered
orally
or
intravenously
and
they
spread
throughout
the
body
instead
of
hitting
just
the
target
regions,
causing
side
effects.
Nanobots
equipped
with
sensors
could
easily
be
used
to
monitor
for
changes
in
regions
of
cells,
reporting
changes
at
the
first
sign
of
damage
or
malfunction.
We
are
still
a
long
way
away
from
these
hypothetical
applications,
but
progress
is
being
made
all
the
time.
As
an
example,
in
2017
scientists
created
nanobots
that
targeted
cancer
cells
and
attacked
them
with
a
miniaturized
drill,
killing
them.
This
year,
a
group
of
researchers
from
ITMO
University
designed
a
nanobot
composed
of
DNA
fragments,
capable
of
destroying
pathogenic
RNA
strands.
DNA-based
nanobots
are
also
currently
capable
of
transporting
molecular
cargo,
The
nanobot
is
made
of
three
different
DNA
sections,
maneuvering
with
a
DNA
“leg”
and
carrying
specific
molecules
with
the
use
of
an
“arm”.
Beyond
medical
applications,
research
is
being
done
regarding
the
use
of
nanobots
for
the
purposes
of
environmental
cleanup
and
remediation.
Nanobots
could
potentially
be
used
to
remove
toxic
heavy
metals
and
plastics
from
bodies
of
water.
The
nanobots
could
carry
compounds
that
render
toxic
substances
inert
when
combined
together,
or
they
could
be
used
to
degrade
plastic
waste
through
similar
processes.
Research
is
also
being
done
on
the
use
of
nanobots
to
facilitate
the
production
of
extremely
small
computer
chips
and
processors,
essentially
using
nanobots
to
produce
microscale
computer
circuits.
