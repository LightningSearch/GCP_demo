Dr.
George
Aronoff 
is
the
Chief
Medical
Officer
at
Dosis
,
and
he
has
over
30
years
of
experience
in
nephrology.
He
was
previously
Chief
of
Nephrology
&amp;
Hypertension
at
the
University
of
Louisville,
where
his
research
with
Drs.
Brier
and
Gaweda
focused
on
using
AI
to
dose
ESAs
in
dialysis
patients.
He
received
his
M.S.
in
Pharmacology
and
M.D.
from
Indiana
University.
Dosis&#8217;​
first
product,
Strategic
Anemia
 
Advisor,
is
a
web-based
reference
tool
that
personalizes
dosing
of
ESAs,
a
class
of
drugs
used
to
treat
chronic
anemia.
Could
you
begin
by
explaining
what
is
the
innovative
AI-based
dosing
platform
Strategic
Anemia
Advisor
(SAA)?
Dosis’
Strategic
Anemia
Advisor
(SAA)
is
an
artificial
intelligence
(AI)-based
clinical
decision
support
system
that’s
been
engineered
to
improve
health
outcomes
of
End-Stage
Kidney
Disease
(ESKD)
patients
and
reduce
drug
costs
by
an
average
of
25
percent
by
personalizing
drug
dosing.
More
than
550,000
End-Stage
Renal
Disease
(ESRD)
patients
in
the
U.S.
are
currently
undergoing
dialysis
treatment,
and
the
majority
of
those
patients
experience
chronic
anemia.
SAA
is
based
on
more
than
10
years
of
research
at
the
University
of
Louisville
and
was
specifically
designed
to
assist
clinical
anemia
managers
with
their
recommendations
for
Erythropoiesis
Stimulating
Agents
(ESAs)
dosing.
What
are
some
of
the
benefits
of
offering
personalized
dosing
recommendations?
AI
helps
clinicians
determine
the
minimum
dose
required
to
achieve
the
desired
therapeutic
outcome,
which
has
both
clinical
and
economic
benefits.
In
the
case
of
dosing
ESAs,
inefficient
dosing
can
result
in
significantly
higher
than
necessary
drug
exposure
for
patients,
and
correspondingly
elevated
costs
of
care.
SAA
is
focused
on
fine-tuning
dose
titrations
based
on
a
patient’s
demonstrated
drug
response.
As
dose
changes
are
made
regularly,
it
is
in
a
patient’s
best
interest
to
receive
the
smallest
amount
of
a
drug,
as
greater
exposure
to
ESA
is
associated
with
higher
risk
of
heart
attack,
stroke,
thrombosis,
and
cancer
recurrence.
As
the
leader
in
this
area,
Dosis’s
SAA
delivers
a
solution
that
has
had
proven
results,
which
have
allowed
it
to
gain
widespread
acceptance
by
top
dialysis
organizations.
To
date,
SAA
has
been
used
to
deliver
over
2
million
dosing
recommendations.
Drug
dosing
driven
by
AI
is
gaining
ground
in
many
areas
of
medicine,
such
as
dialysis,
cancer
and
transplant
medicine.
It
is
in
these
areas
that
increasingly
precise
dosing
plays
a
critical
role
in
achieving
favorable
outcomes.
AI-powered
precision
dosing
is
particularly
impactful
in
the
management
of
drugs
used
to
manage
chronic
conditions,
as
both
the
potential
for
adverse
events
and
the
cost
of
care
increase
over
the
months
and
years
that
patients
are
on
these
drugs.
How
is
artificial
intelligence
used
to
identify
the
recommended
dosage
amount?
SAA
uses
artificial
intelligence
to
place
patients
on
a
spectrum
of
ESA
dose
response,
from
extreme
responder
(someone
who
is
very
sensitive
to
a
drug)
to,
essentially,
non-responder.
This
estimation
is
done
by
evaluating
a
patient’s
historical
response
to
the
drug
and
constructing
a
unique
response
profile
for
each
patient.
With
each
subsequent
dose
and
hemoglobin
response,
SAA
refines
that
estimation
to
more
precisely
achieve
the
target
hemoglobin
using
the
lowest
possible
ESA
dose.
What
type
of
reduction
in
medication
utilization
have
clinics
seen
from
this?
With
consistent
use
of
SAA,
clinics
have
seen
on
average
a
25%
reduction
in
ESA
utilization
with
maintained
or
improved
anemia
outcomes,
as
well
as
a
75%
reduction
in
time
spent
managing
anemia.
Could
you
discuss
how
AI-powered
precision
dosing
will
likely
be
the
standard
of
care
for
chronic
disease
management
in
the
future?
To
inform
dosing
decisions,
doctors
have
historically
relied
primarily
on
their
clinical
experience,
knowledge
of
the
medications
they
are
prescribing,
and
paper-based
recommendations
for
dosing
from
drug
manufacturers
and
the
FDA.
However,
these
recommendations
are
often
imprecise,
as
they
draw
from
clinical
studies
that
may
or
may
not
accurately
reflect
an
individual
patient’s
response
to
the
medication.
Precision
dosing
has
been
identified
as
a
crucial
method
to
maximize
therapeutic
safety
and
efficacy
with
significant
potential
benefits
for
patients
and
healthcare
providers,
and
AI-powered
solutions
have
so
far
proven
to
be
among
the
most
powerful
tools
to
actualize
precision
dosing.
Today,
five
factors
have
come
together
to
make
AI-powered
drug
dosing
a
reality.
They
include:
Technological
advancements in
computing,
which
allow
us
to
process
large,
complex
datasets
quickly,
making
AI
solutions
practical.
Public
familiarity with
artificial
intelligence
as
an
effective
tool
for
solving
complex
problems,
which
makes
physicians
comfortable
incorporating
such
tools
in
clinical
settings.
Reliable
data is
now
available
in
electronic
medical
records
and
is
standardized
in
a
manner
that
is
much
more
ingestible
by
algorithms
as
compared
to
free-form
paper
medical
records.
Big
data analytics techniques
have
also
made
applying
artificial
intelligence
and
control
algorithms
to
complex
datasets
much
more
practical
and
efficient.
Today,
we
can
draw
on
data
from
millions
of
patients
to
design
and
test
algorithms
in
silicon
to
predict
effectiveness
and
iterate
quickly.
This
is
a
vast
improvement
on
expert
systems
that
are
based
on
a
clinician’s
smaller
number
of
patients,
possibly
in
the
thousands
or
hundreds,
that
are
generally
only
possible
to
test
in
much
more
costly
and
risky
clinical
trials.
Increasingly
complex
and
powerful
drugs
have
been
developed
that
impact
basic
physiologic
processes.
Drugs
that
impact
multiple
physiologic
processes
and
have
a
narrow
therapeutic
window
(the
“sweet
spot”
between
toxicity
and
ineffective
therapy)
have
become
more
prevalent.
These
are
the
types
of
drugs
for
which
AI-powered
drug
dosing
can
provide
the
most
benefit.
Taking
it
a
step
beyond
precision
dosing,
what
are
some
of
your
views
on
the
overall
future
of
personalized
medicine?
In
10
years,
I
believe
AI-driven
dosing
models
will
likely
be
the
standard
of
care
across
the
healthcare
spectrum,
used
for
a
wide
variety
of
drugs
like
warfarin,
insulin
and
immunosuppressives.
Basically,
any
drug
that
is
administered
chronically
and
has
a
narrow
therapeutic
range
is
a
good
candidate
for
AI-driven
dosing.
In
addition,
as
more
tools
are
developed
and
more
opportunities
to
use
those
tools
are
identified,
we
will
see
exponential
growth
in
the
use
of
AI
to
drive
therapies,
interpret
laboratory
and
radiographic
findings,
and
predict
outcomes
of
therapeutic
strategies.
Is
there
anything
else
that
you
would
like
to
share
about
