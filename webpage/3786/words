Machine
learning
algorithm
specialist 
Ayasdi
has
raised
$55
million
in
a
new
investment
that
doubles
the
company&#8217;s
total
capital.
The
Series
C
round
was
led
by
Kleiner
Perkins
Caufield
&amp;
Byers
(KPCB),
and
featured
participation
from
existing
investors
Citi
Ventures,
FLOODGATE,
Institutional
Venture
Partners
(IVP),
and
Khosla
Ventures.
New
investors
Centerview
Capital
Technology
and
Draper
Nexus
were
also
part
of
the
investment,
which
takes
Ayasdi&#8217;s
total
funding
to
more
than
$100
million.
Ted
Schlein
of
KPCB
praised
Ayasdi&#8217;s
ability
to
make
complex
data
analysis
easier
for
large
institutions
and
organizations.
He
cited
the
technology&#8217;s
combination
of
&#8220;machine
learning
algorithms
with
topological
mathematics
and
artificial
intelligence&#8221;
as
a
&#8220;breakthrough
innovation
that
will
drive
the
next
information
and
productivity
wave
in
the
coming
decade.&#8221;
Health
care
systems
have
been
among
the
most
eager
adopters
of
the
Ayasdi&#8217;s
technology.
But
the
company
is
working
with
three
of
the
five
largest
financial
institutions
in
the
world
to
help
them
make
smarter
lending
decisions,
improve
risk
and
compliance
modeling,
protect
against
fraud,
and
better
serve
private
banking
clients.
Deborah
Hopkins,
Chief
Innovation
Officer
of
Citi
and
CEO
of
Citi
Ventures
said
the
technology
provided
insights
that
&#8220;enable
Citi
to
tailor
services
to
specific
client
needs,
operate
more
efficiently,
and
mitigate
risk.&#8221;
