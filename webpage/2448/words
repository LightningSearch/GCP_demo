Laying
The
Foundation
For
A
Successful
Hybrid
Workforce
Global
research
firm
Gartner
sees
working
from
home
as
a
“cornerstone
of
the
post-pandemic
future
of

and
projects
that
nearly
one
in
five
employees
will
work
remotely
all
the
time
after
the
pandemic
has
ended.

Are
Fleeing
New

And
California
Now
that
working
from

has
taken
its
hold,
the
trend
offers
CEOs
options.
No
longer
do
they
have
to
pay
for
expensive
real
estate
in
New
York
City
or
San
Francisco.
They
can
have
people
working
remotely
or
relocate
jobs
to
locations
that
are
less
costly.

New
Year,
New
Employees:
How
To
Onboard
While
Remote
Making
the
right
hire
is
just
the
beginning;
it’s
imperative
to
integrate
new
employees
into
the
culture
and
foster
a
sense
of
community
and
inclusion.
How
does
one
do
that
in
2021
and
beyond,
as
remote
work
becomes
more
normal
than
ever
before?

Make
When

Remote

While

empathy
and
emotional

the
boundaries
of

offices,
leading
well

has
a
different
set
of
challenges
than
leading

in-person.

What
Hewlett
Packard
Enterprise’s
Departure
From
Silicon
Valley
Means
For
The
Tech
Industry
While
the
rise
of
remote
work
has
certainly
prompted
many
companies
to
reconsider
whether
it’s
necessary
to
have
a
physical
presence
in
the
Bay
Area,
the
total
calculus
is
far
more
complex,
factoring
in
larger
changes
in
technology,
infrastructure,
specialized
labor
markets
and—of
course—taxes.

Hawaii
Seeks
Remote
Workers
To
Ride
Out
The
Pandemic
In
Paradise
Hawaii
saw
its
economy
suffer
due
to
a
lack
of
tourism—a
large
revenue
source—and
the
closures
or
limited
operations
of
many
businesses.
In
an
effort
to
turn
things
around,
state
officials,
intent
on
reviving
the
lackluster
economy,
started
a
program
to
bring
remote
workers
to
the
state.
