The

Experience
Students

So

How
To
Avoid
High
Turnover
Costs
By
Bringing
Former
Employees
Back
To
Work
Even
with
the
economy
rallying,
the
expense
of
filling
open
positions
can
be
significant
and
represent
a
financial
challenge
to
companies
still
struggling
to
recover
from
lost
revenue.
One
alternative:
bring
qualified
individuals
back
to
work
and
rehire
former
employees.

The
Pandemic
Has
Changed
The
Game
For
Learning
And
Primed
Education
For
Continued
Disruption
When
it
comes
to
education,
we
can’t
afford
gaps
in
learning
and
particularly
during
a
pandemic,
students
risk
falling
behind.
It’s
not
as
simple
as
flipping
to
virtual
learning
we
need
the
tools
to
support
and
empower
teachers
and
learners
while
creating
continuous
