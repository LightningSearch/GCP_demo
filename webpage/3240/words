Gen
Z
will
put
a
lot
of
pressure
on
brands,
forcing
them
to
go
beyond
touting
their
environmental
sustainability
efforts
and
take
real
action.
Younger
generations
are
more
likely
to
demand
full
transparency
on
how
brands
impact
the
planet’s
resources,
more
prone
to
use
apps
like
Yuka
or
Buycott
to
scan
food
or
cosmetic
ingredients,
and
more
willing
to
boycott
products
and
brands.
It
would
be
a
mistake
to
think
this
phenomenon
is
restricted
to
the
young.&nbsp;
In
fact,
half
of
the
US
population
is
already
green
according
to
Forrester’s
green
segmentation.
European
consumers
are
greener
and
more
willing
to
buy
from
sustainable
brands.
French
and
Italian
online
adults
see
a
firm’s
position
on
climate
change
as
the
number
one
corporate
social
responsibility
issue
(it
ranks
only
number
seven
in
the
US).
They
are
also
more
likely
than
their
US
peers
to
buy
sustainable
and
organic
products
or
go
out
of
their
way
to
buy
from
companies
that
are
committed
to
reducing
their
impact
on
the
environment.&nbsp;In
Forrester’s&nbsp;new
report,&nbsp;"Greener
Consumers
Demand
Sustainable
Brands,”&nbsp;this
phenomenon
is
not
new,
but
the
crisis
is
accelerating
it.&nbsp;
By
forcing
people
to
focus
on
health
and
hygiene,
the
pandemic
strengthened
the
perception
that
environmental
sustainability
affects
our
personal
lives.
We
care
more
and
more
about
the
food
and
medicine
we
put
in
our
bodies,
the
cosmetics
we
apply,
the
clothes
we
wear&nbsp;and
the
cleaning
products
we
use
in
our
homes.
Brands
in&nbsp;the
food,
health,&nbsp;consumer&nbsp;packaged
goods
(CPG)&nbsp;and
fashion
industries
are
taking
notice
and
establishing
a
more
emotional
relationship
with
consumers
for
everyday
products.&nbsp;
Sustainability&nbsp;Will&nbsp;Spur&nbsp;A&nbsp;New&nbsp;Business&nbsp;Transformation&nbsp;Imperative.
&nbsp;
While
most
firms
are
still&nbsp;in
the
midst
of&nbsp;their
digital
and
customer
experience
transformations,
the
green
revolution
will
spur
a
new
business
transformation
imperative.
Leaders
are
launching
bold,&nbsp;enterprise-wide&nbsp;transformation
initiatives
backed
by
the
C-suite.&nbsp;CMOs
should
embrace
sustainability
as
their
next
companywide
transformation.
Those
who
fail
to
do
so
can
expect
creative
disruptors,&nbsp;investors&nbsp;and
activists
of
green
technology
to
sabotage
their
brand
equity.
More
broadly,
sustainability
will
be
the
next
source
of
competitive&nbsp;advantage.&nbsp;
Appointing
a
dedicated
C-level
executive
to
lead
sustainability
efforts
is
not
enough.
“Bolt-on”
chief
sustainability
officers
will
last
no
longer
than
chief
digital
officers.
To
truly
transform
their
firms
and
gain
competitive&nbsp;advantage,
CEOs
must
embed
sustainability
everywhere
in
their
organization
and
initiate
deep
cultural
change.&nbsp;As
Chris
Leong,
CMO
of
Schneider
Electric
(recently
recognized
as
the
world’s
most
sustainable
corporation)
told
me:
“Our
core
strategy
is
to
focus
on
clean
energy
transition.
However,
environmental
sustainability
is
just
one
side
of
the
coin.
Broader
sustainability
efforts
improve
performance,
innovation,
and
our
attractiveness
as
a
brand.
It
creates
value.”&nbsp;CMOs
must
focus
on
value
creation,
conducting
broader
sustainable
ecosystems
of
internal
and
external
partners.&nbsp;

The&nbsp;Recent&nbsp;Governance&nbsp;Crisis&nbsp;At&nbsp;Danone&nbsp;Illustrates&nbsp;The&nbsp;Need&nbsp;To&nbsp;Marry&nbsp;Sustainability&nbsp;And&nbsp;Profitability.
&nbsp;
Sustainable
global
brands
will
also
have
to
pivot
to
a
trusted
multilocal
operating
model.
Among
other
geopolitical
disruptive
forces,
climate
change
will
play
a
key
role
in&nbsp;the&nbsp;emergence
of
multilocal
firms.
For
example,
Danone
is&nbsp;definitely
on&nbsp;the
right
path
when
embracing
a
new
“local-first”
strategic
plan
to
reorganize
the
firm.
“We
have
to
[keep
our
distance
from]
the
pyramidal
heritage
of
most
large
organizations
of
the
20th
century;
we
will
reorganize
the
company
to
listen
to
each
market
and
make
sure
decisions
are
taken
at
the
country
level,”
said
CEO
Emmanuel
Faber
recently.&nbsp;

Brazilian
Proptech

Hits
$2.2
Billion
Valuation
With
$425
Million
Series
D
Round
Over
the
past
few
years,
Danone
made
some
bold
decisions,
such
as
its
$11
billion
acquisition
of
WhiteWave,
a
leader
in
organic
foods.
Danone’s
mission
is
to
“bring
health
through
food
to
as
many
people
as
possible”
with
an
ambitious
tagline:
“One
Planet,
One
Health.”&nbsp;
However,
Danone’s
board
ousted
Emmanuel
Faber
after
pressure
from
an
activist
investor
group.
Isn’t
Danone’s
governance
crisis
the
best
counterargument
that
you
can’t
marry
sustainability
and
profits?
As&nbsp;
the&nbsp;
Financial
Times
&nbsp;recently
noted:
“If
France’s
most
prominent
advocate
of
purpose-driven
capitalism
cannot
make
it
work,
critics
are
bound
to
ask
what&nbsp;is
the
purpose
of
‘purpose’?”&nbsp;
The
Danone
case
study
highlights
the
tensions
between
shareholder
and
stakeholder
capitalisms.
Emmanuel
Faber
certainly
made
some
mistakes,
but
let’s
be
fair:
He
was
a
visionary
leader
and
for
many
years
embodied
Danone’s
values
and
DNA.
His
farewell
letter
to
Danone’s
employees
made
a
great
point
with
an
almost
prophetic
tone:
“Danone
trailed
the
path
of
social
and
climate
justice.
This
is
the
only
road
possible
for
the
market
economy.
It
will
impose
itself
on
capitalism
and
its
governance
of
the
past.”&nbsp;
While
it
is
true
that
Danone’s
returns
lag
those
of
rivals
such
as
Nestlé
and
Unilever,
the
story
is
much
more
complex
than
it
looks.
Many
firms
(including
Danone)
have
proven
that
it’s
possible
to&nbsp;marry&nbsp;sustainability
and
profitability.&nbsp;It
depends
on
how
much
profit
you&nbsp;have
to&nbsp;deliver
if
15%
ROCE
is
the
norm
and
if
politicians
will
impose
other
societal
and
ecological
norms
moving
forward.&nbsp;
Consumers’
and
employees’
social
activism
will
define
which
flavor
of
capitalism
will
gain
the
most
traction
between
Nordics’
flexicurity,
Germany’s&nbsp;
soziale&nbsp;Marktwirtschaft
,
and
the
more
free-market
approach
of
the
US
and
the
UK.&nbsp;
This
debate
is
not
new
—
but
the
crisis
is
reactivating
it.&nbsp;
