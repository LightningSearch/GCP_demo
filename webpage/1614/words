Edge
AI
is
one
of
the
most
notable
new
sectors
of
artificial
intelligence,
and
it
aims
to
let
people
run
AI
processes
without
having
to
be
concerned
about
privacy
or
slowdowns
due
to
data
transmission.
Edge
AI
is
enabling
greater,
more
widespread
use
of
AI,
letting
smart
devices
react
quickly
to
inputs
without
access
to
a
cloud.
While
that’s
a
quick
definition
of
Edge
AI,
let’s
take
a
moment
to
better
understand
Edge
AI
by
exploring
the
technologies
that
make
it
possible
and
seeing
some
use
cases
for
Edge
AI.
What
is
Edge
Computing?
In
order
to
truly
understand
Edge
AI,
we
need
to
first
understand
Edge
computing,
and
the
best
way
to
understand
Edge
computing
is
to
contrast
it
with
cloud
computing.
Cloud
computing
is
the
delivery
of
computing
services
over
the
internet.
In
contrast,
Edge
computing
systems
are
not
connected
to
a
cloud,
instead
of
operating
on
local
devices.
These
local
devices
can
be
a
dedicated
edge
computing
server,
a
local
device,
or
an
Internet
of
Things
(IoT)
.
There
are
a
number
of
advantages
to
using
Edge
computing.
For
instance,
internet/cloud-based
computation
is
limited
by
latency
and
bandwidth,
while
Edge
computing
is
not
limited
by
these
parameters.
What
is
Edge
AI?
Now
that
we
understand
Edge
computing
we
can
take
a
look
at
Edge
AI
.
Edge
AI
combines
Artificial
Intelligence
and
edge
computing.
The
AI
algorithms
are
run
on
devices
capable
of
edge
computing.
The
advantage
of
this
is
that
the
data
can
be
processed
in
real-time,
without
having
to
connect
to
a
cloud.
Most
cutting
edge
AI
processes
are
carried
out
in
a
cloud
as
they
mandate
a
large
amount
of
computing
power.
The
result
is
that
these
AI
processes
can
be
vulnerable
to
downtime.
Because
Edge
AI
systems
operate
on
an
edge
computing
device,
the
necessary
data
operations
can
occur
locally,
being
sent
when
an
internet
connection
is
established,
which
saves
time.
The
deep
learning
algorithms
can
operate
on
the
device
itself,
the
origin
point
of
the
data.
Edge
AI
is
becoming
increasingly
important
due
to
the
fact
that
more
and
more
devices
need
to
employ
AI
in
situations
where
they
cannot
access
the
cloud.
Consider
how
many
factory
robots
or
how
many
cars
these
days
come
with
computer
vision
algorithms.
A
lag
time
in
the
transmission
of
data
in
these
situations
could
be
catastrophic.
Self-driving
cars
cannot
suffer
from
latency
while
detecting
objects
on
the
street.
Since
a
quick
response
time
is
so
important,
the
device
itself
must
have
an
Edge
AI
system
that
allows
it
to
analyze
and
classify
images
without
relying
on
a
cloud
connection.
When
edge
computers
are
entrusted
with
the
information
processing
tasks
usually
carried
out
on
the
cloud,
the
result
is
real-time
low
latency,
real-time
processing.
Additionally,
by
restricting
the
transmission
of
data
to
just
the
most
vital
information,
the
data
volume
itself
can
be
reduced
and
communication
interruptions
can
be
minimized.
Edge
AI
and
the
Internet
of
Things
Edge
AI
meshes
with
other
digital
technologies
like
5G
and
the
Internet
of
Things
(IoT).
IoT
can
generate
data
for
Edge
AI
systems
to
make
use
of,
while
5G
technology
is
essential
for
the
continued
advancement
of
both
Edge
AI
and
IoT.
The
Internet
of
Things
refers
to
a
variety
of
smart
devices
connected
to
one
another
through
the
internet.
All
of
these
devices
generate
data,
which
can
be
fed
into
the
Edge
AI
device,
which
can
also
act
as
a
temporary
storage
unit
for
the
data
until
it
is
synced
with
the
cloud.
The
method
of
data
processing
allows
for
greater
flexibility.
The
fifth
generation
of
the
mobile
network,
5G
,
is
critical
for
the
development
of
both
Edge
AI
and
the
Internet
of
Things.
5G
is
capable
of
transferring
data
at
much
higher
speeds,
up
to
20Gbps,
whereas
4G
is
capable
of
delivering
data
at
only
1Gbps.
5G
also
supports
far
more
simultaneous
connections
than
4G
(1,000,000
per
square
kilometer
vs.
100,000)
and
a
better
latency
speed
(1ms
vs.
10ms).
These
advantages
over
4G
are
important
because
as
the
IoT
grows,
data
volume
grows
as
well
and
transfer
speed
is
impacted.
5G
enables
more
interactions
between
a
wider
range
of
devices,
many
of
which
can
be
equipped
with
Edge
AI.
Use
Cases
For
Edge
AI
Use
cases
for
Edge
AI
include
just
about
any
instance
where
data
processing
would
be
done
more
efficiently
on
a
local
device
than
when
done
through
a
cloud.
However,
some
of
the
most
common
use
cases
for
Edge
AI
include
self-driving
cars
,
autonomous
drones
,
facial
recognition
,
and
digital
assistants
.
Self-driving
cars
are
one
of
the
most
relevant
use
cases
for
Edge
AI.
Self-driving
cars
must
constantly
be
scanning
the
surrounding
environment
and
assessing
the
situation,
making
corrections
to
its
trajectory
based
on
nearby
events.
Real-time
data
processing
is
critical
for
these
cases,
and
as
a
result,
their
onboard
Edge
AI
systems
are
in
charge
of
the
data
storage,
manipulation,
and
analysis.
The
edge
AI
systems
are
necessary
to
bring
level
3
and
level
4
(fully
autonomous)
vehicles
to
the
market.
Because
autonomous
drones
are
not
piloted
by
human
operators,
they
have
very
similar
requirements
for
autonomous
cars.
If
a
drone
loses
control
or
malfunctions
while
flying,
it
can
crash
and
damage
property
or
life.
Drones
may
fly
far
out
of
range
of
an
internet
access
point,
and
they
must
have
Edge
AI
capabilities.
Edge
AI
systems
will
be
indispensable
for
services
like
Amazon
Prime
Air,
which
aims
to
deliver
packages
via
drone.
Another
use
case
for
Edge
AI
is
facial
recognition
systems.
Facial
recognition
systems
rely
on
computer
vision
algorithms,
analyzing
data
collected
by
the
camera.
Facial
recognition
apps
that
operate
for
the
purposes
of
tasks
like
security
need
to
operate
reliably
even
if
they
are
not
connected
to
a
cloud.
Digital
assistants
are
another
common
use
case
for
Edge
AI.
Digital
assistants
like
Google
Assistant,
Alexa,
and
Siri
must
be
able
to
operate
on
smartphones
and
other
digital
devices
even
when
they
are
not
connected
to
the
internet.
When
data
is
processed
on
the
device
there&#8217;s
no
need
to
deliver
it
to
the
cloud,
which
helps
reduce
traffic
and
ensure
privacy.
