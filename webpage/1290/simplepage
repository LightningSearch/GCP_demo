Gretchen Whitmer has appointed Trina Govan Scott and Reverend Joseph “Joe” Jones to the board of trustees at Oakland University in Rochester. Both have been appointed to terms that will run through August 2028. Their appointments were subject to the advice and consent of the Senate, and the new members replace Ric DeVore and Marianne Fey, whose board service ended Aug. 11. “I want to congratulate Trina and Joe on their appointments and share that I look forward to working with them to strengthen Oakland University’s already highly respected reputation,” says Tonya Allen, chair of the board. “Both have tremendous talent and professional experience, as well as deep dedication to Oakland, and I have no doubt they will provide the board of trustees invaluable perspective and guidance.” Scott is chief diversity officer at Rock Ventures. Campus recruitment has become central to her department’s efforts. Before joining Rock Ventures, Scott was assistant director at Ernst and Young, managing diversity and inclusion and then corporate responsibility programs. An alumna of OU’s School of Business Administration, former member of the women’s basketball team, and a member of the Oakland University Alumni Association board, Scott presented a keynote address during OU’s spring 2019 commencement. She was also a featured speaker for the Alumni Association’s Leadership OU program, which connects students with alumni mentors and industry leaders. Scott serves as a board member for the Midnight Golf Program, Inforum, and the Rocket Giving Fund, is a member of the Mortgage Bankers Association Diversity and Inclusion Committee, and is a former board member of the Detroit Police Athletic League. Jones grew up on the east side of Detroit. He has served as the second ward city commissioner since 2016 and has been president and CEO of the Grand Rapids Urban League since 2011. He is also co-chair of the Urban Core Collective, through which he leads an organization that promotes economic empowerment and civil rights for minority communities. He previously served as president and CEO of E.E. Milestone and Associates, managing partner at Strategic Communications Group, and public relations and marketing manager for Construction Trades Subcontracting Inc. Boards Jones serves on include the Mercantile Bank of Michigan, Experience Grand Rapids, and Spectrum Health Hospital Group. He is an ordained clergy member and serves as assistant pastor with the Brown-Hutcherson Ministries in Grand Rapids. After completing his bachelor’s degree in communications from OU, he went on to earn a master’s degree in ministry leadership from Cornerstone University. “We greatly appreciate the expertise, insight, and dedication of Ric and Marianne and are thankful for their years of service,” says Ora Hirsch Pescovitz, president of OU. “I am also looking forward to working with our new trustees, Trina and Joseph. As OU alumni, they bring unique first-hand experiences of our university. Their professional backgrounds, proven talents, and compassion will be vital in guiding our campus community for the foreseeable future.” Facebook Comments TAGS On The Move Facebook Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp Previous article Moceri, 400 Monroe Associates Acquire Riverfront UAW-GM Center Next article Ann Arbor-based Clinc Names Jon Newhard CEO Grace Turner RELATED ARTICLES MORE FROM AUTHOR Gary Goodman Joins Human Element’s Strategy Team Mark Hirschhorn Named to Hygieia Board Family Law Attorney Henry S.
