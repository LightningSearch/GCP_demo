Like
most
industries,
fintech
and
banking
have
experienced
massive
disruptions
in
the
past
six
months.
As
we’ve
gone
through
the
process
of
enforced
change,
the
big
question
facing
our
industry
is
essentially
the
same
as
the
one
facing
the
entire
world
right
now:&nbsp;
what
is
the
new
“normal”
going
look
like?
But
before
we
get
there,
we&#8217;re
living
through
a
moment
that
people
will
remember.
Customers
will
remember
how
they
were
treated
by
their
banks,
and
banks
will
remember
which
tech
companies
helped
them
take
care
of
their
customers
(and
which
didn’t).
It
will
be
important
to
stay
focused
on
the
big
picture,
and
get
remembered
for
the
right
reasons.
FinovateFall
Digital
2020&nbsp;
honed
in
on
the
technologies
changing
the
game
this
year,
and
put
the
thought
leaders
with
a
view
for
leveraging
the
opportunities
this
time
offers
up
on
the
center
stage.
The
event
eMagazine
was
exclusively
available
to
FinovateFall
Digital
attendees
for
the
week
of
the
event,
but
now
we
are
making
it
available

Finovate
community.&nbsp;

from
the

insight
