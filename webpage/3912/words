CardFlight
Unveils
EMV-Ready
Chip
Readers
for
SwipeSimple

Spring
is
in
the
air,
but
for
merchants
planning
for
the
liability
shift
in
October,
fall
is
not
far
away.
With
this
in
mind,
mobile
point
of
sale
innovator
CardFlight
has
announced
that
its
EMV-ready
card
chip
readers
are
now
available
for
merchants
using
the
company&#8217;s
SwipeSimple
mPOS
solution.
The
October
EMV
liability
shift
is
an
effort
to
reduce
credit
card
fraud
in
the
U.S.
Specifically,
it
refers
to
issue
of who
will
take
the
blame
&#8211;
the
bank
or
the
merchant
&#8211;
when
credit
card
fraud
occurs
on
a
card
with
a
magnetic
stripe
rather
than
an
embedded
EMV
chip.
The
upshot
is
that
banks
can
protect
themselves
in
the
post-October
2015
era
by
offering
their
customers
cards
with
the EMV technology,
and
merchants
can
protect
themselves
by
deploying
technology
that
can
read
EMV-enabled
cards.
The
EMV standard
is
widespread
in
other
parts
of
the
world, 
especially
Europe
,
where
EMV
card
adoption
stands
at
more
than
80%.

FinovateSpring
2013.
Derek
Webster,
CardFlight
founder
and
CEO,
said:
&#8220;By
offering
the
EMV-ready
readers
today,
CardFlight&#8217;s
partners
can
be
confident
that
they
are
giving
their
merchants
future-proof
technology
that
will
last
well
beyond
the
October
2015
EMV
liability
shift.&#8221;
&#8220;While
some
providers
have
announced
plans
to
offer
mobile
EMV
card
readers,
CardFlight
is
one
of
the
first
to
actually
make
them
available
for
purchase
and
deployment
in
the
United
States.&#8221;
CardFlight
also
announced
that
it
is 
teaming
up
with
POS
Portal
,
which
will
serve
as
a
launch
partner
for
the
company&#8217;s
EMV
POS
technology.
POS
Portal
distributes
more
than
1,200
POS
devices
a
day
to
merchants
around
the
U.S.
CardFlight
has
enjoyed
a
strong
momentum
in
recent
months.
The
company
reported
in
January
that
it
partnered
with
Integrity
Payment
Systems
,
an
Illinois-based
company
that
processes
$3
billion
in
credit
card
volume
a
year.
In
December,
Merchants
Choice
Payment
Systems,
a
full-service
credit
and
debit
processor
that
serves
more
than
50,000
merchants
and
processes
$12
billion
in
sales
volume
a
year,
announced
its
plans
to
provide
a
custom
mobile
POS
solution
for
its
merchants,
courtesy
of
CardFlight.
CardFlight
has
presented
its
technology
at
both
Finovate
(
FinovateSpring
2013
)
and
FinDEVr
(
FinDEVr
San
Francisco
2014
)
conferences.
The
company
was
founded
in
February
2013
and
is
headquartered
in
New
York
City.
