A
team
of
researchers
from
Brazil’s
Center
for
Nuclear
Energy
in
Agriculture
(CENA)
and
the
Luiz
de
Quieroz
College
of
Agriculture
(ESALQ)
have
created
an
AI-driven
method
of
seed
quality
analysis
,
dramatically
reducing
the
time
needed
to
determine
the
quality
of
agricultural
seeds.
According
to
Phys.org
,
the
research
team
collected
images
of
seeds
with
the
use
of
light-based
imaging
technology.
The
techniques
used
by
the
research
team
included
multispectral
imaging
and
chlorophyll
fluorescence.
The
research
team
selected
carrots
and
tomatoes
to
serve
as
their
experimental
models,
choosing
different
variants
to
produce
in
different
countries
and
under
different
conditions.
The
seeds
they
selected
were
commercial
tomato
varieties
produced
in
the
US
and
in
Brazil,
as
well
as
commercial
carrot
varieties
produced
in
Italy,
Chile,
and
Brazil.
Demand
for
these
crops
is
rising
around
the
globe,
but
collecting
the
seeds
for
these
crops
can
be
difficult.
Both
carrots
and
tomatoes
have
ripening
processes
that
aren’t
uniform.
Seed
production
for
these
crops
is
also
non-synchronous,
meaning
that
seeds
lots
extracted
from
these
tomatoes
and
carrots
can
contain
both
mature
and
immature
seeds.
It
isn’t
easy
to
distinguish
between
mature
and
immature
seeds
with
the
eye,
but
computer
vision
systems
can
make
this
process
easier.
Traditionally,
seeds
are
assessed
by
either
germination
and
vigor
tests.
Germination
tests
involve
the
sowing
and
germination
of
seeds,
while
vigor
tests
aim
to
assess
how
seeds
respond
to
stress.
It
can
two
weeks
or
more
to
obtain
results
from
these
tests,
meaning
that
machine
learning
techniques
are
dramatically
faster
than
these
traditional
seed
analysis
techniques.
After
collecting
the
training
images,
the
researchers
used
a
random
forest
classifier
to
automate
the
interpretation
of
the
seed
images.
This
optical
imaging
system
has
many
advantages
over
traditional
methods
of
analyzing
seeds,
one
of
which
is
the
fact
that
the
optical
imaging
technology
can
be
used
on
entire
batches
of
seeds
instead
of
just
small
samples
of
those
batches.
Another
advantage
the
method
has
over
traditional
seed
assessment
techniques
is
that
the
computer
vision
technique
is
non-invasive,
so
it
doesn’t
destroy
any
products
analyzed.
One
method
of
analyzing
seed
quality
the
researchers
used
was
chlorophyll
fluorescence. 
Algorithms
developed
by
the
research
team
made
use
of
the
presence
of
chlorophyll
within
seeds.
Chlorophyll
supplies
the
energy
seeds
need
for
development,
and
if
the
seed
still
has
large
volumes
of
residual
chlorophyll
within
it,
this
implies
the
seed
isn’t
fully
mature.
This
residual
chlorophyll
can
be
detected
with
multispectral
imaging,
with
red
light
exciting
the
chlorophyll
and
special
devices
capturing
its
fluorescence
and
converting
it
into
an
electrical
signal.
Multispectral
imaging
involves
the
use
of
LEDs
to
emit
light
at
varying
points
on
the
light
spectrum.
The
researchers
split
the
emitted
light
into
19
different
wavelengths
and
analyzed
seed
quality
based
on
reflectance
for
these
different
wavelengths.
They
then
compared
the
results
they
obtained
with
quality
data
obtained
through
typical
seed
analysis
methods.
The
researchers
found
that
using
near-infrared
light
works
best
for
the
assessment
of
carrot
seeds
while
UV
light
worked
best
for
the
assessment
of
UV
tomato
seeds.
Seeds
contain
proteins,
sugars,
and
lipids
that
absorb
certain
wavelengths
of
light
while
reflecting
the
rest
of
the
light.
A
multispectral
camera
is
used
to
capture
the
reflective
light,
and
the
resulting
image
data
is
used
to
find
the
seeds
within
the
entire
captured
image.
The
more
of
a
given
nutrient
that
a
seed
contains
the
more
light
wavelengths
corresponding
to
that
is
absorbed.
A
series
of
algorithms
is
used
to
identify
which
wavelength
does
the
best
at
localizing
the
seeds.
This
process
can
be
used
to
provide
information
about
the
chemical
composition
of
the
seeds
being
studies,
allowing
their
quality
to
be
inferred.
The
research
team
then
employed
chemometrics,
which
are
mathematical
and
statistical
models
used
to
classify
materials,
to
create
the
classes
that
described
seed
quality.
Finally,
the
researchers
were
able
to
use
machine
learning
models
to
assess
the
accuracy
of
the
chemometrics
models
they
created.
In
the
case
of
tomato
seeds,
the
quality
classification
accuracy
ranged
from
86%
to
95%.
In
the
case
of
carrot
seeds,
the
accuracy
ranged
from
88%
to
97%.
Both
the
chlorophyll
fluorescence
technique
and
the
multispectral
imaging
technique
proved
reliable
and
much
faster
than
traditional
methods
of
assessing
seed
quality.
If
the
method
proves
reliable,
it
has
the
potential
to
bring
higher
quality
seeds
to
growers
around
the
world.
