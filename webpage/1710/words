What
is
Natural
Language
Processing
(NLP)?
Natural
Language
Processing
(NLP)
is
the
study
and
application
of
techniques
and
tools
that
enable
computers
to
process,
analyze,
interpret,
and
reason
about
human
language.
NLP
is
an
interdisciplinary
field
and
it
combines
techniques
established
in
fields
like
linguistics
and
computer
science.
These
techniques
are
used
in
concert
with
AI
to
create
chatbots
and
digital
assistants
like
Google
Assistant
and
Amazon’s
Alexa.
Let’s
take
some
time
to
explore
the
rationale
behind
Natural
Language
Processing,
some
of
the
techniques
used
in
NLP,
and
some
common
uses
cases
for
NLP.
Why
Natural
Language
Processing
(NLP)
Matters
In
order
for
computers
to
interpret
human
language,
they
must
be
converted
into
a
form
that
a
computer
can
manipulate.
However,
this
isn’t
as
simple
as
converting
text
data
into
numbers.
In
order
to
derive
meaning
from
human
language,
patterns
have
to
be
extracted
from
the
hundreds
or
thousands
of
words
that
make
up
a
text
document.
This
is
no
easy
task.
There
are
few
hard
and
fast
rules
that
can
be
applied
to
the
interpretation
of
human
language.
For
instance,
the
exact
same
set
of
words
can
mean
different
things
depending
on
the
context.
Human
language
is
a
complex
and
often
ambiguous
thing,
and
a
statement
can
be
uttered
with
sincerity
or
sarcasm.
Despite
this,
there
are
some
general
guidelines
that
can
be
used
when
interpreting
words
and
characters,
such
as
the
character
“s”
being
used
to
denote
that
an
item
is
plural.
These
general
guidelines
have
to
be
used
in
concert
with
each
other
to
extract
meaning
from
the
text,
to
create
features
that
a
machine
learning
algorithm
can
interpret.
Natural
Language
Processing
involves
the
application
of
various
algorithms
capable
of
taking
unstructured
data
and
converting
it
into
structured
data.
If
these
algorithms
are
applied
in
the
wrong
manner,
the
computer
will
often
fail
to
derive
the
correct
meaning
from
the
text.
This
can
often
be
seen
in
the
translation
of
text
between
languages,
where
the
precise
meaning
of
the
sentence
is
often
lost.
While
machine
translation
has
improved
substantially
over
the
past
few
years,
machine
translation
errors
still
occur
frequently.

(NLP)
Techniques

Many
of
the
techniques
that
are
used
in
natural
language
processing
can
be
placed
in
one
of
two
categories:
syntax
or
semantics.
Syntax
techniques
are
those
that
deal
with
the
ordering
of
words,
while
semantic
techniques
are
the
techniques
that
involve
the
meaning
of
words.
Syntax
NLP
Techniques
Examples
of
syntax
include:
Lemmatization
Morphological
Segmentation
Part-of-Speech
Tagging
Parsing
Sentence
Breaking
Stemming
Word
Segmentation
Lemmatization
refers
to
distilling
the
different
inflections
of
a
word
down
to
a
single
form.
Lemmatization
takes
things
like
tenses
and
plurals
and
simplifies
them,
for
example,
“feet”
might
become
“foot”
and
“stripes”
may
become
“stripe”. 
This
simplified
word
form
makes
it
easier
for
an
algorithm
to
interpret
the
words
in
a
document.
Morphological
segmentation
is
the
process
of
dividing
words
into
morphemes
or
the
base
units
of
a
word.
These
units
are
things
like
free
morphemes
(which
can
stand
alone
as
words)
and
prefixes
or
suffixes.
Part-of-speech
tagging
is
simply
the
process
of
identifying
which
part
of
speech
every
word
in
an
input
document
is.
Parsing
refers
to
analyzing
all
the
words
in
a
sentence
and
correlating
them
with
their
formal
grammar
labels
or
doing
grammatical
analysis
for
all
the
words.
Sentence
breaking,
or
sentence
boundary
segmentation,
refers
to
deciding
where
a
sentence
begins
and
ends.
Stemming
is
the
process
of
reducing
words
down
to
the
root
form
of
the
word.
For
instance,
connected,
connection,
and
connections
would
all
be
stemmed
to
“connect”.
Word
Segmentation
is
the
process
of
dividing
large
pieces
of
text
down
into
small
units,
which
can
be
words
or
stemmed/lemmatized
units.
Semantic
NLP
Techniques
Semantic
NLP
techniques
include
techniques
like:
Named
Entity
Recognition
Natural
Language
Generation
Word-Sense
disambiguation
Named
entity
recognition
involves
tagging
certain
text
portions
that
can
be
placed
into
one
of
a
number
of
different
preset
groups.
Pre-defined
categories
include
things
like
dates,
cities,
places,
companies,
and
individuals.
Natural
language
generation
is
the
process
of
using
databases
to
transform
structured
data
into
natural
language.
For
instance,
statistics
about
the
weather,
like
temperature
and
wind
speed
could
be
summarized
with
natural
language.
Word-sense
disambiguation
is
the
process
of
assigning
meaning
to
words
within
a
text
based
on
the
context
the
words
appear
in.
Deep
Learning
Models
For
NLP
Regular
multilayer
perceptrons
are
unable
to
handle
the
interpretation
of
sequential
data,
where
the
order
of
the
information
is
important.
In
order
to
deal
with
the
importance
of
order
in
sequential
data,
a
type
of
neural
network
is
used
that
preserves
information
from
previous
timesteps
in
the
training.
Recurrent
Neural
Networks
are
types
of
neural
networks
that
loop
over
data
from
previous
timesteps
,
taking
them
into
account
when
calculating
the
weights
of
the
current
timestep.
Essentially,
RNN
’s
have
three
parameters
that
are
used
during
the
forward
training
pass:
a
matrix
based
on
the
Previous
Hidden
State,
a
matrix
based
on
the
Current
Input,
and
a
matrix
that
is
between
the
hidden
state
and
the
output.
Because
RNNs
can
take
information
from
previous
timesteps
into
account,
they
can
extract
relevant
patterns
from
text
data
by
taking
earlier
words
in
the
sentence
into
account
when
interpreting
the
meaning
of
a
word.
Another
type
of
deep
learning
architecture
used
to
process
text
data
is
a
Long
Short-Term
Memory
(LSTM)
network
.
LSTM
networks
are
similar
to
RNNs
in
structure,
but
owing
to
some
differences
in
their
architecture
they
tend
to
perform
better
than
RNNs.
They
avoid
a
specific
problem
that
often
occurs
when
using
RNNs
called
the
exploding
gradient
problem.
These
deep
neural
networks
can
be
either
unidirectional
or
bi-directional.
Bi-directional
networks
are
capable
of
taking
not
just
the
words
that
come
prior
to
the
current
word
into
account,
but
the
words
that
come
after
it.
While
this
leads
to
higher
accuracy,
it
is
more
computationally
expensive.

Because
Natural
Language
Processing
involves
the
analysis
and
manipulation
of
human
languages,
it
has
an
incredibly
wide
range
of
applications.
Possible
applications
for
NLP
include
chatbots,
digital
assistants,
sentiment
analysis,
document
organization,
talent
recruitment,
and
healthcare.
Chatbots
and
digital
assistants
like
Amazon’s
Alexa
and
Google
Assistant
are
examples
of
voice
recognition
and
synthesis
platforms
that
use
NLP
to
interpret
and
respond
to
vocal
commands.
These
digital
assistants
help
people
with
a
wide
variety
of
tasks,
letting
them
offload
some
of
their
cognitive
tasks
to
another
device
and
free
up
some
of
their
brainpower
for
other,
more
important
things.
Instead
of
looking
up
the
best
route
to
the
bank
on
a
busy
morning,
we
can
just
have
our
digital
assistant
do
it.
Sentiment
analysis
is
the
use
of
NLP
techniques
to
study
people’s
reactions
and
feelings
to
a
phenomenon,
as
communicated
by
their
use
of
language.
Capturing
the
sentiment
of
a
statement,
like
interpreting
whether
a
review
of
a
product
is
good
or
bad,
can
provide
companies
with
substantial
information
regarding
how
their
product
is
being
received.
Automatically
organizing
text
documents
is
another
application
of
NLP.
Companies
like
Google
and
Yahoo
use
NLP
algorithms
to
classify
email
documents,
putting
them
in
the
appropriate
bins
such
as
“social”
or
“promotions”.
They
also
use
these
techniques
to
identify
spam
and
prevent
it
from
reaching
your
inbox.
Groups
have
also
developed
NLP
techniques
are
being
used
to
identify
potential
job
hires,
finding
them
based
on
relevant
skills.
Hiring
managers
are
also
using
NLP
techniques
to
help
them
sort
through
lists
of
applicants.
NLP
techniques
are
also
being
used
to
enhance
healthcare.
NLP
can
be
used
to
improve
the
detection
of
diseases.
Health
records
can
be
analyzed
and
symptoms
extracted
by
NLP
algorithms,
which
can
then
be
used
to
suggest
possible
diagnoses.
One
example
of
this
is
Amazon’s
Comprehend
Medical
platform,
which
analyzes
health
records
and
extracts
diseases
and
treatments.
Healthcare
applications
of
NLP
also
extend
to
mental
health.
There
are
apps
such
as
WoeBo
t,
which
talks
users
through
a
variety
of
anxiety
management
techniques
based
in
Cognitive
Behavioral
Therapy.
