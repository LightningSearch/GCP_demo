Their
ideas
change
how
we
travel,
shop,
learn
and
more.
Increasingly,
entrepreneurs
are
examining
how
their
businesses
can
create
a
more
sustainable
way
of
life.
Here
are
three
Under
30
visionaries
who
are
taking
that
goal
to
the
next
level.

During
her
college
years,
Lauren
Singer
began
to
develop
an
understanding
that
social
and
environmental
justice
go
hand-in-hand.
She
turned
that
knowledge
and
her
passion
for
advocacy
and
grassroots
community
engagement
into
a
blog
entitled,
“Trash
Is
For
Tossers,”
in
2012.&nbsp;
“When
I
went
to
college,
I
ended
up
studying
environmental
science
to
really
understand
all
of
the
systems
that
create
this
reality
we
live
in
and
the
future
that
we
will
grow
into,”
she
says.&nbsp;
That’s
what
led
her
to
found
Package
Free,
a
one-stop
shop
based
on
the
value
of
creating
a
more
complete
option
for
people
to
reduce
their
waste.
Since
its
inception
in
2017,
Package
Free
has
sold
a
vast
array
of
products
ranging
from
health
and
beauty
products
to
office
supplies
to
toys
for
pets.
Today,
as
we
navigate
the
Covid-19
landscape,
Singer
is
optimistic
and
feels
this
time
has
allowed
people
to
step
back
and
examine
their
own
habits.

Growing
up
in
an
immigrant
household,
where
Abhi
Ramesh
says
every
meal
was
home-cooked,
he
got
an
early
education
on
the
importance
of
both
food
accessibility
and
affordability.
Living
in
West
Philadelphia,
Ramesh
noticed
that
many
people
would
need
a
car
to
access
quality
markets—and
many
options
on
the
outskirts
of
town
had
much
higher
prices
than
those
in
the
inner
city.
“There's
so
many
families
that
can't
feed
themselves
affordably,”
he
says,
“And
have
to
rely
on
either
unhealthy
food
or
don't
have
access
to
the
calories
they
need.”
Ramesh
turned
those
observations
into
a
business,
launching
Misfits
Market
in
2018.
It
began
with
Ramesh
selling
unwanted
produce
from
farms,
later
evolving
into
a
subscription
service
for
“ugly”
organic
produce—and
has
rescued
over
65
million
pounds
of
food
unwanted
by
grocery
stores
due
to
cosmetic
imperfections
or
oversupply.
“We're
trying
to
tackle
food
waste...on
a
fundamental
level,”
he
says.&nbsp;
“What
we're
trying
to
do
is
sort
of
show
the
dollar
value
and
cultural
value
of
cooking
your
meals.”

At
only
16
years
old,
Derrick
Emsley
was
building
a
tree-planting
business
with
his
brother,
as
a
way
to
offset
carbon
emissions.
By
2012,
that
mission
had
developed
into
Tentree—an
apparel
brand
seeking
to
plant
trees
around
the
world.&nbsp;&nbsp;
“We
felt
like
a
lot
of
people
were
just
talking
about
the
issues
and
very
few
people
were
really
focused
on
how
to
create
effective
solutions
to
it,”
he
says.
“For
us,
it
was
about
tree
planting.”
All
of
Tentree’s
clothes
are
made
with
sustainable
materials
and
each
product
comes
with
a
unique
code
for
the
ten
trees
that
will
be
planted
thanks
to
that
purchase.
Buyers
can
use
that
code
to
track
where
the
trees
will
be
planted.&nbsp;
To
date,
the
company
has
planted
more
than
50
million
trees
worldwide.
Looking
ahead,
Emsley
wants
Tentree
to
include
a
digital
platform
that
keeps
tabs
on
trees
planted
all
over
the
world.
The
goal
is
an
on-the-ground,
real-time
service—which
would
also
help
to
employ
local
communities
and
expand
education
about
their
work.

Founded
in
1824
in
the
heart
of
Speyside,
The
Macallan
was
one
of
the
first
distilleries
in
Scotland
to
be
legally
licensed.
Since
then
it
has
built
a
reputation
as
one
of
the
world’s
finest
single
malt
whiskies.
The
story
of
The
Macallan
is
built
on
the
Six
Pillars,
each
influencing
the
whisky
in
its
own
distinct
way.
From
the
spiritual
home
of
Easter
Elchies
House;
curiously
small
stills
giving
richness
to
the
pure
spirit;
finest
cut
or
the
best
of
the
best
of
the
distillation
to
exceptional
oak
casks
which
account
for
over
80%
of
the
final
whisky;
natural
color
and
finally
peerless
spirit,
The
Macallan
itself.
Wood
sits
at
the
heart
of
The
Macallan.
The
vital
contributing
influences
of
Spain,
North
America
and
Scotland,
together
with
true
mastery,
set
it
apart
from
the
rest.
