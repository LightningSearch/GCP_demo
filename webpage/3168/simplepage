Increasingly, entrepreneurs are examining how their businesses can create a more sustainable way of life. Here are three Under 30 visionaries who are taking that goal to the next level. <fbs-ad position="top" progressive ad-id="article-0-top"> <fbs-embedly style="padding-bottom: 70.83%;" iframe-src="https://embedly.forbes.com/widgets/media.html?src=%2F%2Fview.ceros.com%2Fforbes%2Flauren-desktop&amp;display_name=Ceros&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fview.ceros.com%2Fforbes%2Flauren-desktop&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia-s3-us-east-1.ceros.com%2Fforbes%2Fpage-thumbnails%2F2020%2F12%2F14%2Fc580723ab5aa69e86dae6c0d9d04bea4%2Fpage-thumbnail.jpg%3FimageOpt%3D1%26crop%3D870%2C616%2Cx0%2Cy0&amp;key=3ce26dc7e3454db5820ba084d28b4935&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=ceros"> During her college years, Lauren Singer began to develop an understanding that social and environmental justice go hand-in-hand. She turned that knowledge and her passion for advocacy and grassroots community engagement into a blog entitled, “Trash Is For Tossers,” in 2012.&nbsp; “When I went to college, I ended up studying environmental science to really understand all of the systems that create this reality we live in and the future that we will grow into,” she says.&nbsp; That’s what led her to found Package Free, a one-stop shop based on the value of creating a more complete option for people to reduce their waste. Since its inception in 2017, Package Free has sold a vast array of products ranging from health and beauty products to office supplies to toys for pets. Today, as we navigate the Covid-19 landscape, Singer is optimistic and feels this time has allowed people to step back and examine their own habits. <fbs-embedly style="padding-bottom: 70.83%;" iframe-src="https://embedly.forbes.com/widgets/media.html?src=%2F%2Fview.ceros.com%2Fforbes%2Flauren-desktop-1&amp;display_name=Ceros&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fview.ceros.com%2Fforbes%2Flauren-desktop-1&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia-s3-us-east-1.ceros.com%2Fforbes%2Fpage-thumbnails%2F2020%2F12%2F14%2F2662e9fe3b2d4c349aac50929c9c2b65%2Fpage-thumbnail.jpg%3FimageOpt%3D1%26crop%3D870%2C616%2Cx0%2Cy0&amp;key=3ce26dc7e3454db5820ba084d28b4935&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=ceros"> Growing up in an immigrant household, where Abhi Ramesh says every meal was home-cooked, he got an early education on the importance of both food accessibility and affordability. Living in West Philadelphia, Ramesh noticed that many people would need a car to access quality markets—and many options on the outskirts of town had much higher prices than those in the inner city. “There's so many families that can't feed themselves affordably,” he says, “And have to rely on either unhealthy food or don't have access to the calories they need.” Ramesh turned those observations into a business, launching Misfits Market in 2018. It began with Ramesh selling unwanted produce from farms, later evolving into a subscription service for “ugly” organic produce—and has rescued over 65 million pounds of food unwanted by grocery stores due to cosmetic imperfections or oversupply. “We're trying to tackle food waste...on a fundamental level,” he says.&nbsp; “What we're trying to do is sort of show the dollar value and cultural value of cooking your meals.” <fbs-embedly style="padding-bottom: 70.83%;" iframe-src="https://embedly.forbes.com/widgets/media.html?src=%2F%2Fview.ceros.com%2Fforbes%2Flauren-desktop-1-1&amp;display_name=Ceros&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fview.ceros.com%2Fforbes%2Flauren-desktop-1-1&amp;image=https%3A%2F%2Fmedia-s3-us-east-1.ceros.com%2Fforbes%2Fpage-thumbnails%2F2020%2F12%2F14%2F2e1e8c75e11166901e6082167c823ac5%2Fpage-thumbnail.jpg%3FimageOpt%3D1%26crop%3D870%2C616%2Cx0%2Cy0&amp;key=3ce26dc7e3454db5820ba084d28b4935&amp;type=text%2Fhtml&amp;schema=ceros"> At only 16 years old, Derrick Emsley was building a tree-planting business with his brother, as a way to offset carbon emissions. By 2012, that mission had developed into Tentree—an apparel brand seeking to plant trees around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp; “We felt like a lot of people were just talking about the issues and very few people were really focused on how to create effective solutions to it,” he says. “For us, it was about tree planting.” All of Tentree’s clothes are made with sustainable materials and each product comes with a unique code for the ten trees that will be planted thanks to that purchase. Buyers can use that code to track where the trees will be planted.&nbsp; To date, the company has planted more than 50 million trees worldwide. Looking ahead, Emsley wants Tentree to include a digital platform that keeps tabs on trees planted all over the world. The goal is an on-the-ground, real-time service—which would also help to employ local communities and expand education about their work.

Since then it has built a reputation as one of the world’s finest single malt whiskies. The story of The Macallan is built on the Six Pillars, each influencing the whisky in its own distinct way. From the spiritual home of Easter Elchies House; curiously small stills giving richness to the pure spirit; finest cut or the best of the best of the distillation to exceptional oak casks which account for over 80% of the final whisky; natural color and finally peerless spirit, The Macallan itself. Wood sits at the heart of The Macallan. The vital contributing influences of Spain, North America and Scotland, together with true mastery, set it apart from the rest. For more information on The Macallan, visit www.themacallan.com . The Macallan can also be found on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram. &nbsp;Read Less Print Reprints &amp; Permissions
