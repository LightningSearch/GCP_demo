Before
becoming
a
doctor,
David
Levine
was
a
high
school
teacher
in
a
tough
neighborhood
in
Chicago,
where
he
would
often
make
house
calls
to
tutor
students
and
check
in
on
them.
“That's
where
I
learned
this
amazing
power
of
taking
care
or
teaching
in
people's
homes,”
says
Levine.
“You
immediately
understand
a
lot
of
the
drivers
and
things
going
on
in
their
lives
and
from
that
you
can
then
look
for
solutions
for
them.”
<fbs-ad
position="top"
progressive
ad-id="article-0-top">
Nowadays
he
is
applying
the
same
principle
in
medicine.
He
helps
reimagine
ways
for
hospitals
to
take
care
of
sick
patients
in
the
comfort
of
their
own
homes,
as
the
medical
director
of
strategy
and
innovation
for
Brigham
Health
Home
Hospital
in
Boston.
For
a
century,
Americans
have
been
trained
“to
call
911
and
go
to
the
hospital
when
they're
sick,”
says
Levine.
But
a
growing
body
of
evidence
shows
that
for
some
conditions,
high-level
care
provided
in
the
home
can
result
in
better
patient
outcomes
at
a
lower
cost.
Levine
was
the
first
author
of
a
randomized
controlled
trial
that
found
home-hospital
care
was
on
average
38%
less
expensive
than
care
delivered
in
the
four
walls
of
a
hospital.
Plus,
patients
were
less
likely
to
have
to
be
readmitted
within
30
days.&nbsp;
In
November,
the
federal
government
announced
it
would
start
reimbursing
home-
hospital
services
for
60
different
conditions
at
the
same
rates
as
in-hospital
services.
Like
many
trends
in
healthcare,
big
change
comes
on
the
heels
of
Medicare
reimbursement,
as
commercial
insurers
often
follow
suit.

Two
Boston-based
startups—Medically
Home
and
Biofourmis—are
among
a
growing
number
of
companies
providing
the
technology
that
makes
this
transformation
possible
more
widely.
And
the
revolution
isn’t
limited
to
patients
requiring
hospitalization.
There’s
also
been
a
raft
of
new
technologies
from
companies
like
Teladoc
Health
and
Dexcom
that
help
patients
with
chronic
diseases,
like
diabetes
and
hypertension,
better
monitor
day-to-day
fluctuations
and
stay
healthy.&nbsp;
The
right
combination
of
sensors,
artificial
intelligence
and
trained
staff
can
monitor
issues
ranging
from
infections
to
heart
failure
in
the
home.
But
the
challenge
for
doctors
and
companies
in
this
space
is
getting
the
word
out.
“We
have
a
big
public
health
messaging
campaign
to
do—to
basically
retrain
people
and
say,
‘The
hospital
is
definitely
the
place
to
go
for
some
things,’”
says
Levine.
“But
a
home
hospital
may
get
you
even
better
care,
even
better
outcomes
for
certain
conditions.”

Hospital
expenditures
in
the
U.S.
totaled
nearly
$1.2
trillion
in
2019.
That
was
before
the
Covid-19
pandemic
swept
the
globe,
inundating
intensive
care
units
with
ventilated
patients
and
postponing
many
elective
procedures.
It
ushered
in
a
new
era
of
telehealth,
as
providers
scrambled
for
ways
to
interact
with
patients
outside
of
brick
and
mortar
facilities.
“People
don't
want
to
go
to
the
hospital
because
they
can't
have
visitors.
They're
separated
from
loved
ones,
and
they're
worried
they're
going
to
get
Covid
if
they
don't
already
have
it,”
says
Eliza
“Pippa”
Shulman,
a
primary
care
physician
and
chief
medical
officer
of
Medically

“I
really
want
to
approach
technology
in
a
way
that
it's
so
easy
to
use,
it
disappears
for
the
patient,”
says
Shulman.
“For
our
patients,
what
they
comment
on
over
and
over
again
is
the
relationship
that
they
have
with
their
care
team.”&nbsp;
Biofourmis
started
with
an
outpatient
monitoring
system
and
is
moving
into
the
home-hospital
space.
More
than
110,000
patients
have
used
the
company’s
wearable
sensors
and
artificial
intelligence
platform
in
the
past
year,
ranging
from
Covid-19
to
heart
failure.
The
Biovitals
platform
analyzes
biomarker
signals
from
patients
and
communicates
any
worrisome
changes
to
their
physicians,
which
CEO
Kuldeep
Singh
Rajput,
likes
to
call
an
“early
warning
score.”&nbsp;
An
old
reliable
standby
for
doctors
to
check
on
their
patients’
heart
health
is
the
electrocardiogram,
which
records
signals
from
the
heart
and
requires
a
patient
to
come
to
the
office.
When
reviewing
those
signals,
doctors
are
ensuring
they
don’t
reach
a&nbsp;
certain
threshold.
The
drawback
is
that
this
method
is
binary:
The
signals
either
hit
the
threshold
or
they
don’t.
The
Biofourmis
system,
by
contrast,
is
more
nuanced:
It
takes
a
composite
of
a
bunch
of
different
signals
and
considers
them
together.
The
startup
has
co-developed
a
patient
and
clinician
portal
specific
to
home-hospital
care
with
Brigham
and
Women’s
Hospital.

,
is
expecting
a
huge
boost
to
the
company’s
hospital
business
as
more
health
systems
are
looking
for
vendors
on
account
of
the
federal
rule
changes.
The
company
raised
$100
million
led
by
Softbank
last
year
and
is
beginning
to
offer
clinical
services
in
conjunction
with
its
technology.
“We
are
really
transitioning
ourselves
from
being
a
technology
vendor
to
a
tech-enabled
healthcare
provider,”
says
Rajput.&nbsp;

Ninety
percent
of
$3.8
trillion
in
annual
healthcare
spending
in
the
U.S.
can
be
traced
back
to
patients
with
chronic
or
mental
health
conditions,
according
to
the
CDC
.
Those
costs
could
be
significantly
reduced
if
it
were
possible
to
catch
problems
early,
so
patients
didn’t
have
to
go
to
the
hospital.
Technology
has
the
potential
to
play
a
role
here,
too.
Last
year,
Teladoc
Health
merged
with
chronic
disease
management
platform
Livongo
in
an
$18.5
billion
deal.
The
combined
company
says
that
it
is
taking
a
“whole
person”
approach
to
maintaining
health,
looking
beyond
one
disease,
like
diabetes,
and
considering
other
issues
the
patient
is
facing.
“So
often
these
things
are
tackled
in
silos,
and
it
means
that
a
person
doesn't
know
what
to
focus
on
next,”
says
Amar
Kendale,
chief
product
officer
at
Teladoc
Health.
“If
you
try
to
focus
on
everything,
of
course,
you're
not
focusing
on
anything.”&nbsp;

But
here’s
the
thing:
People
don’t
want
to
have
to
spend
big
chunks
of
their
day
monitoring
multiple
chronic
conditions.
“You
want
to
have
the
best
possible
outcome
with
the
least
possible
effort,”
he
says.
That
was
the
idea
behind
Livongo’s
connected
blood
glucose
meter.
Blood
glucose
levels
need
to
stay
within
a
certain
range
in
order
to
avoid
complications,
which
at
the
most
extreme
end
could
result
in
diabetic
coma.
With
traditional
methods,
patients
may
take
regular
blood
sugar
measurements
by
pricking
their
finger
with
a
needle-like
device
known
as
a
lancet,
but
not
record
them.
Livongo
says
it’s
simplified
the
process.
Patients
are
automatically
sent
test
strips
and
lancets
free
of
charge.
The
blood
sugar
measurements
are
automatically
uploaded
to
the
cloud.
That
data
fuels
a
smartphone
app
that
uses
both
artificial
intelligence
software
and
human
coaches
to
give
personalized
recommendations
to
diabetes
patients.&nbsp;
Now
Teladoc
is
partnering
with
Dexcom,
which
manufacturers
continuous
glucose
monitors,
on
a
new
pilot
program.
The
program
intends
to
explore
whether
continuous
glucose
monitors
might
improve
the
health
of
those
with
Type
2
diabetes.
More
than
30
million
Americans
have
diabetes—which
means
their
body
has
trouble
producing
insulin,
which
helps
the
body
regulate
blood
sugar
levels.
Type
1
diabetics
don’t
produce
any
insulin,
which
means
they
need
to
continually
monitor
their
levels
through
a
sensor
attached
to
the
skin
and
inject
insulin.
The
pilot
program
will
explore
whether
Type
2
diabetics,
who
do
produce
some
insulin
naturally,
would
benefit
from
this
type
of
monitoring.&nbsp;
“There's
going
to
be
a
lot
of
opportunity
for
us
to
think
about
using
it
maybe
once
a
quarter,
or
once
a
month,”
says
Kendale.
One
example
would
be
when
someone
is
changing
medication
or
looking
to
change
their
diet.
The
next
step
will
be
incorporating
the
virtual
physician
support,
which
is
Teladoc’s
core
business.&nbsp;
This
combination
of
remote
monitoring
and

is
really

pandemic
has
been

we
see
this
as
the
future.”&nbsp;
