Finie:
Experience
The
Clinc
Difference
In
the
demo
below,
you
can
get
a
first-hand
look
at
the
superiority
of
Clinc
’s
virtual
assistant
Finie
versus
a
leading
brand
competitor.
We’re
sure
you
will
see
the
difference
in
experience
after
watching
the
video,
but
you
can
also
read
below
to
get
a
detailed
look
at
how
Clinc’s
tech
is
differentiated
in
the
market
for
conversational
AI. 
Messy
Language
Clinc
has
the
ability
to
understand
natural
and
unconstrained
language
in
the
way
that
people
tend
to
speak
in
their
everyday
lives.
Virtual
assistants,
like
the
ones
you
see
from
competitors,
use
grammar
and
linguistic
rules
that
determine
parts
of
speech
tagging
and
keywords.
But
the
problem
with
this
approach
is
people
do
not
tend
to
speak
in
this
structure. 
Clinc’s
technique
is
a
purely
data-driven
approach
that
allows
our
machine
learning
models
to
identify
semantic
patterns
in
speech
that
ultimately
results
in
an
experience
where
the
AI
can
understand
slang,
and
messy
language.
Context
Matters
Clinc’s
tech
is
able
to
maintain
context
throughout
a
conversation,
as
the
user
jumps
from
one
topic
to
another.
This
is
what
creates
that
human
in
the
room
experience
that
other
virtual
assistants
in
the
market
are
unable
to
do.
In
the
demo
above,
as
the
narrator
asks
about
spending
history,
Finie
is
able
to
maintain
the
context
that
he
was
still
referring
to
Ann
Arbor
in
the
last
year
for
food
and
drink
whereas
those
variables
were
completely
ignored
by
the
competing
virtual
assistant. 
Conversational
Healing
Lastly,
Clinc’s
ability
to
allow
a
user
to
go
back
and
update
pieces
of
information
in
the
conversation
without
starting
over
is
a
technical
differentiator
we’ve
coined
conversational
healing. 
Often
when
users
want
to
confirm
an
order
or
are
filling
out
a
form,
they
may
change
their
mind
or
realize
they
need
to
change
certain
pieces
of
information.
With
other
virtual
assistants,
when
the
user
does
this
it
will
break
the
model
and
bring
them
back
to
the
starting
point
of
the
conversation.
Because
of
the
way
Clinc
has
designed
our
conversational
AI,
which
does
not
use
scripts
or
decision
trees,
we
are
able
to
allow
the
user
to
go
back
and
heal
the
conversation.
Clinc’s
goal
with
our
conversational
AI
is
to
create
a
true
human
in
the
room
experience.
For
every
prototype
demo
or
virtual
assistant
that
we
create,
the
gut
check
is
always
“is
this
as
competent
as
a
human?”
This
exceedingly
high
expectation
continually
drives
us
to
innovate
and
differentiate
our
tech
from
the
rest
of
the
industry.
