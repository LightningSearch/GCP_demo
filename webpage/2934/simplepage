American Family Auto Insurance American Family Insurance sells insurance for cars, classic cars, RVs, ATVs, snowmobiles and boats. For those who enjoy heading out on the road on two wheels, American Family Insurance also sells motorcycle insurance. Optional coverage types include: Roadside emergency assistance Rental reimbursement Uninsured motorist coverage Underinsured motorist coverage Accidental death and dismemberment Commercial auto insurance Rideshare insurance For drivers worried about a rate increase after an accident, American Family offers accident forgiveness. You can purchase this coverage if you’ve had no at-fault accidents or violations in the last 12 months and no more than one at-fault accident in the last three years. Or you can “earn” accident forgiveness if you haven’t had any at-fault accidents in the last five years. For drivers who have a car loan or lease, American Family sells gap insurance. While collision and comprehensive insurance only pay the actual value of your car if it’s totaled, this form of coverage will help pay the difference (the “gap”) between the value of the car and what you owe on your loan or lease. American Family Insurance Usage-Based Auto Insurance American Family Insurance sells a usage-based auto insurance policy called KnowYourDrive, which monitors and scores your driving habits. You’ll get a small discount just for signing up. You can earn up to a 20% discount after you complete the program, based on your safe driving habits. American Family Car Insurance Discounts American Family Insurance offers several discounts, especially for drivers who practice safe driving habits. If you have a young driver in your family, look for discounts for “young volunteers” and good students. Other American Family discounts include: Multi-vehicle discount: Qualify for a reduced rate if you insure two or more vehicles on the same policy. Loyalty discount: Customers who have been insured with American Family for a certain number of years may be rewarded with a price break. Early bird discount: If you’re with another insurance provider and get an auto insurance quote from American Family Insurance seven days before the policy goes into effect, you could get a discount. Multi-product discount: A reduced rate for those who bundle home and auto insurance policies. Steer Into Savings discount: If you switch to American Family Insurance after having a policy with a competitor, you could get a discount. Auto safety equipment discount: Features like factory-installed air bags and other safety features can get you a reduced rate. Defensive driver discount: If you are age 55 or older, earn a discount for taking a defensive driving course. Good driving discount: If you’ve maintained a clean driving record with no traffic violations, accidents or claims, you could be rewarded with a discount. Low mileage discount: Drivers who drive less than 7,500 miles per year may be eligible for savings. Good student discount: If your student driver gets good grades, you can save on your insurance premiums. Teen Safe Driver discount: This program offers auto insurance discounts for teens who practice safe-driving habits. Away at school discount: This discount is for parents of students who are under age 25, more than 100 miles away at school and without a car at school. Young volunteer discount: Does your teen love giving back? If so, you could save money if they are under age 25 and complete 40 hours of volunteer work per year for a non-profit. Generational discount: If your mom or dad is an American Family Insurance customer, then you could save on your auto policy. Autopay discount: When you enroll in automatic payments or electronic recurring payments, you qualify for a discount. Customer full pay discount: You can get a discount when you pay your premium in full when you sign up or renew your policy. Paperless discount: Simply switch to online billing and electronic policy documents. Geico Car Insurance Geico sells insurance for cars, motorcycles and classic cars. For those who enjoy a little more adventure, Geico also sells insurance for RVs, ATVs and boats. Optional coverage types for auto insurance includes emergency road service, rental reimbursement and mechanical breakdown insurance. If you’re concerned about a rate increase after an accident, Geico offers accident forgiveness insurance which you can pay to add to your policy or earn by maintaining a clean driving record. Geico will waive the first at-fault accident caused by an eligible driver listed on your policy. For those who drive for rideshare companies such as Uber or Lyft, Geico offers rideshare insurance. This insurance fills in the coverage gap between your personal auto insurance policy and the commercial policy offered by a ride-sharing company. Geico also sells Mexico auto insurance if you plan to drive south of the border. Geico Auto Insurance Discounts Geico offers many discounts, especially for drivers who practice safe driving habits. If you’re in the military or are part of an emergency deployment, you could receive between 15% and 25% off your policy. And, if you’re a loyal customer, you can benefit from the multi-vehicle discount or the multiple policy discount. Other auto insurance discounts include: Vehicle equipment discounts: Does your car have some of the latest safety features such as side airbags or full front-seat airbags, anti-lock brakes or an anti-theft system? If so, you could save up to 40% off the medical payments or personal injury portion of your policy. Discounts for driving history and habits: If you have a good driving record and are accident-free for five years you can receive up to 26% off most coverages. Also, if you and your passengers wear seat belts, you can save up to 15% off the medical payments or personal injury protection portion of your policy. Driving course discounts: If you complete a defensive driving course, you can save on your premium. Drivers education discount: If you have a young driver on your policy who completes a driver’s education course, you may be eligible for discounts on most of your coverage types. Good student discount: For drivers who are between age 16 and 24 and enrolled in school full-time, you might be able to receive a discount if they receive a B average. Federal employee discount: Whether you’re an active or retired federal employee, you can receive up to 8% off of your auto insurance premium. Membership and employee discounts: Geico has partnered with more than 500 alumni associations, fraternities and sororities, and professional organizations to offer discounts to its members. Military discount: For those who are on active duty, retired from the military, or a member of the National Guard or Reserves, you might be eligible for a discount of up to 15% on your total car insurance premium. Nationwide Car Insurance Nationwide sells insurance for cars, classic cars, RVs, motorcycles, ATVs, scooters, golf carts and boats. For winter enthusiasts, Nationwide sells insurance for snowmobiles. Optional coverage types include roadside assistance coverage and a total loss deductible waiver which waives the physical damage deductible in the event of a total loss of a vehicle. For drivers concerned about paying a high deductible in the event of an accident, Nationwide offers a vanishing deductible. Every year you go without an accident, you can earn $100 off your deductible, up to $500 total. Nationwide also offers accident forgiveness, which helps drivers avoid a rate increase due to an at-fault accident or minor violation. While you have to pay to add this coverage to your policy, it can help offset the premium increase that typically applies to at-fault accidents. Nationwide Pay-Per-Mile Auto Insurance For low-mileage drivers, Nationwide offers SmartMiles, which provides the same coverage as a traditional Nationwide auto insurance policy but largely bases your premium on the actual mileage driven. Your rate consists of two components: a base rate and a variable rate (cost per mile). Since your variable rate is determined by how much you drive, your monthly rate will vary month-to-month. Your miles are tracked via a small device that plugs into your car’s OBD-II port. You can check the number of miles you’ve driven with the SmartMiles dashboard. For those who live near work, who work from home or who have a second car, SmartMiles could be a good way to save money on your auto insurance. Nationwide Auto Insurance Discounts Nationwide offers several discounts, especially for drivers who practice safe driving habits. If you have a driver in high school or college, look for Nationwide’s discounts for good students. If you’re a part of a qualifying organization, you can benefit from an affinity member discount. Other discounts include: Multi-policy discount: You can save on both your home and auto insurance policies when you bundle them together. Accident free and safe driver discounts: If you have a clean driving record you could receive a discount. Defensive driving discount: When you complete a state-approved safety course, you could get a discount. Anti-theft discount: When your vehicle is equipped with certain anti-theft devices, you can receive a discount. Easy pay sign-up discount: When you set up an automatic payment from your bank, you will receive a one-time discount. Nationwide also helps customers save by offering the SmartRide program. For drivers committed to staying alert and following driving laws, the SmartRide program could help you save. When you sign up you can earn up to 10%. Then, based on your driving habits, you could earn up to 40% off your auto insurance. State Farm Car Insurance State Farm sells insurance for cars, motorcycles, RVs, off-road vehicles and boats. For those who have antique and classic cars, State Farm also provides coverage for vintage vehicles. State Farm also sells add-ons such as rideshare insurance and coverage for car rentals and travel expenses. State Farm Auto Insurance Discounts Whether you&#8217;re a safe driver or have multiple vehicles under on one policy, you might be able to save on your premium. It’s important to note all discounts aren’t available in every state. Here are some discounts you might expect if you’re a State Farm customer: Safe driver discount: Whether you maintain an accident-free driving record or educate yourself on best driving practices, you could receive a discount. For example, If you take a defensive driving course or have gone three years without a moving violation or at-fault accident, you could be eligible for a discount. Good student discount: Do you have a full-time student who has a B average or better? If so, you could save up to 25%. And the discount can stay with your student even after graduation (until they reach age 25). Safe vehicle discounts: For drivers who have newer vehicles with the latest safety features, State Farm offers insurance rewards. For example, if your vehicle was made in 1994 or after (depending on the make and model of the car), you could save up to 40% on medical-related coverage. Loyal customer discounts:  Customers who insure more than one vehicle or have other insurance types could land a loyalty discount. For example, drivers who insure at least two vehicles on the same policy could save as much as 20%, and drivers who bundle home, condo or life insurance with an auto insurance policy could save up to 17%. USAA Auto Insurance USAA sells insurance for cars, motorcycles, ATVs, motorhomes, boats and classic cars. And, for those who fly to their destinations, USAA offers aviation insurance. Optional coverage types include roadside assistance and rental reimbursement. For drivers concerned about a rate increase after an at-fault accident, USAA offers accident forgiveness insurance. If you remain accident-free for five years, your premium won’t go up after one at-fault accident. USAA also offers rideshare coverage for drivers with Uber, Lyft and other services. USAA Auto Insurance Discounts If you’ve had USAA auto insurance for a few years, you can benefit from the Length of Membership Savings. Other discounts include: Safe driver discount: Do you have a clean driving record for the past five years? If so, you could save money on your premiums. Defensive driver discount: If you take an approved course to improve your driving skills, you may receive a discount. Driver training discount: Are you younger than age 21? Drivers under 21 can take a basic driving course and save money on their auto insurance policy. Good student discount: For students who maintain good grades, you can receive a discount on your auto insurance. New vehicle discount: For cars that are three years old or newer, you can qualify for this discount. Multi-vehicle discount: If you have two or more vehicles on a policy, you can save money on your policy. Annual mileage: Based on the number of miles you drive per year, you may qualify for a discount. Vehicle storage: When you store your vehicle, you can save up to 60% on your auto insurance.

Who’s Eligible for USAA Insurance? Current and former U.S. military members, and spouses and children of U.S. military members are eligible for USAA insurance. Methodology Forbes Advisor’s ratings of the best auto insurance companies are based on the following measurements. Companies were evaluated in relation to one another within the group we scored. If you’re shopping for auto insurance mainly based on rates, see our ratings of the best cheap car insurance . Rates: One-third of score. Within this category, we gave equal weight to the national average prices for: good drivers with state minimum liability insurance, good drivers with 100/300/100 coverage ($100,000 bodily injury liability per person, $300,000 bodily injury liability coverage per accident, $100,000 for property damage liability), good drivers with 250/500/250 coverage, drivers with 100/300 and a speeding ticket, drivers with 100/300 and an at-fault accident. Source: Quadrant Information Services , a provider of property/casualty insurance pricing and analytics. Customer happiness: One-third of score. Claims satisfaction and customers who are unhappy enough to file a complaint are where an insurer’s service is tested. Even if you’ve been paying a good price, you’ll be unhappy if you feel treated poorly. Within this measurement we gave equal weight to complaints filed with state regulators at their state’s department of insurance and satisfaction ratings among customers who made claims. Sources: Clearsurance , a leading provider of consumer insurance satisfaction ratings and reviews based on evaluations of nearly 160,000 customer reviews across car, home and renters insurance. Customers who gave a score of 4 or 5 on a scale of 1-5 were considered &#8220;satisfied&#8221; with their claims experience. We evaluated claims satisfaction data from the last four years. National Association of Insurance Commissioners , which aggregates complaint data from each state. Its complaint ratios express a company’s number of complaints relative to the size of its business. Tech fundamentals: One-third of score. We’ve come to expect technology to make our lives easier, and that should extend to our car insurance as well. Yet not all auto insurers offer what we consider to be baseline options. To help identify the best car insurance companies, within this category we looked at three factors: Whether the insurer has a mobile app where you can pull up your insurance ID card:  If you’re pulled over or in an auto accident, you don’t want to be digging around to find a paper ID card. Whether the insurer offers usage-based insurance or a pay-per-mile program: With many of us driving less, we want to reap the benefits of those low miles. Usage-based insurance and pay-per-mile programs put you in better control of your own car insurance rates. Whether the insurer offers virtual claims: Not all dents and scratches should require an in-person evaluation by an insurance adjuster. With the right technology, insurers should be able to let you file a claim from your couch , upload damage photos and track the claim. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) How can I find the best price on car insurance? The main key in finding a good deal is to get car insurance quotes from multiple companies. That&#8217;s the only way you&#8217;ll know what companies are going to charge, based on your personal factors. &nbsp; Another strategy is to bundle your auto insurance with another policy, such as homeowners or renters. Buying more than one policy from the same company typically results in a decent discount. What’s the best car insurance company for good rates? USAA had the lowest average rates nationwide among the companies we analyzed. You must be an active member of the military or a veteran to be eligible for USAA auto insurance. The company does not sell to the general public. &nbsp; American Family, Geico and Nationwide had the best auto insurance rates among companies open to everyone in our survey. What types of car insurance are required? Most states (except New Hampshire and Virginia) require liability auto insurance to pay for damage and injuries you cause to others. &nbsp; Many states also require uninsured motorist coverage . This does not pay out to other motorists. It pays for medical bills to you and your passengers if you’re hit by someone who doesn’t have auto insurance—or not enough. &nbsp; And states that have a no-fault insurance system require that car owners buy personal injury protection (PIP). PIP pays your medical bills no matter who caused the accident. What car insurance discounts should I look for? Discounts on vehicle safety equipment, such as air bags, are easy to get. Make sure to get a bundling discount by buying from the same company if you need more than one type of insurance policy. &nbsp; Car insurance discounts for good drivers are common. If you have a teen or young adult driver, you may be able to get a good student discount. And you may be able to get a small discount for things you would do anyway, like going paperless by receiving insurance bills and policies electronically. Next Up in Car Insurance Comprehensive Vs.
