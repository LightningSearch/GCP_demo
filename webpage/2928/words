If

you

against

One
way
is
with

To

the

travel
insurance
we
evaluated
over
50
plans

Plans
were
scored
based
on:
Coverage
for
trip
cancellation
and
medical
expenses
due
to
COVID
The
level
of
those
benefits
Whether
the
plan
also
offers
“cancel

coverage,
which
gives
you
the
option
to

and
get
some
reimbursement

Tips
for
the
Pandemic
Traveler
Many
travel
insurance
policies
offer
good
medical
coverage,
but
not
all
cover
COVID-related
problems.
If
that’s
important
to
you,
make
sure
to
verify
that
the
plan
you’re
buying
specifically
covers
you
in
case
you
contract
COVID,
says
Kasaro
Barto,
spokesperson
for
Squaremouth.
Squaremouth
recommends
a
minimum
of
$100,000
in
emergency
medical
and
medical
evacuation
coverage
in
order
to
account
for
COVID-19
related
medical
care
and
evacuation
expenses.
Sudden
travel
bans
and
unexpected
quarantines
requirements
can
also
derail
your
trip,
too,
but
standard
travel
insurance
may
not
cover
these
problems,
warns
Barto.
Buying
cancel
for
any
reason
coverage
will
give
you
some
reimbursement
no
matter
what
your
reason
for
canceling.
But
add
cancel
for
any
reason
coverage
quickly
if
you
want
it,
advises
Barto.
You
may
have
only
a
couple
weeks
before
the
option
expires
for
your
plan.
Also,
some
travel
destinations
abroad
have
medical
coverage
requirements
for
incoming
travelers.
Confirm
the
medical
coverage
requirements
you’ll
need
for
your
destination
before
you
buy
a
travel
insurance
plan.
Other
Plan
Benefits
to
Look
For
The
plans
listed
above
include
benefits
beyond
trip
cancellation
and
medical
coverage.
Check
out
the
details
to
make
sure
you’re
getting
other
benefits
you
want,
too.
For
example,
the
Cat
70
plan
that
scored
among
the
highest
in
our
rankings
also
provides
reimbursement
for:
Trip
cancellation
due
to
injuries,
weather,
hurricanes
and
terrorism
Travel
delay
Missed
connections
Baggage
and
personal
items
Methodology
Using
data
provided
by
Squaremouth,
Forbes
Advisor
scored
plans
based
on
these
measurements:
COVID
medical
coverage:
20
points.
Plans
earned
points
for
providing
medical
coverage
that
does
not
exclude
COVID.
Type
of
medical
coverage:
20
points.
Plans
earned
points
for
having
primary
medical
coverage
vs.
secondary
coverage.
Primary
coverage
is
often
preferred
by
travelers
who
don’t
want
to
go
through
their
own
health
plans
first
for
a
claim.
Medical
coverage
limits:
Up
to
20
points.
Plans
earned
more
points
for
higher
medical
coverage
amounts.
COVID
cancellation
coverage:
40
points.
Plans
earned
points
for
offering
trip
cancellation
and
interruption
coverage
if
the
traveler
contracts
COVID.
Cancel
for
any
reason
coverage:
20
points.
Plans
earned
points
for
also
offering
cancel
for
any
reason
coverage,
which
allows
cancellation
for
any
reason,
including
fear
of
traveling.
It
generally
adds
about
40%
to
the
travel
insurance
cost.

Frequently
Asked
Questions
(FAQs)
Will
my
health
plan
cover
me
if
I
get
COVID
while
traveling
abroad?
U.S.-based
health
plans
generally
don’t
offer
coverage
outside
the
U.S.
That
makes
it
even
more
important
to
have
travel
insurance
with
medical
benefits.
That
way
you’ll
be
covered
for
injuries
and
illness
while
on
your
trip.
How
much
money
can
I
get
back
with
“cancel
for
any
reason”
coverage?
Cancel
for
any
reason
coverage
generally
reimburses
you
50%
or
75%
of
your
prepaid
and
nonrefundable
trip
expenses.
The
advantage
of
the
coverage
is
that
you
aren’t
limited
to
cancellation
reasons
defined
by
the
policy.
Will
my
pre-existing
conditions
be
covered
by
travel
insurance?
Many
travel
insurance
plans
offer
“pre-existing
medical
condition
exclusion
waivers.”
These
waivers
mean
that
your
existing
medical
conditions
won’t
be
excluded
from
coverage.
But
note
that
these
waivers
must
be
added
quickly
after
your
initial
trip
deposit—usually
within
two
or
three
weeks.
