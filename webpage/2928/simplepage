If that’s important to you, make sure to verify that the plan you’re buying specifically covers you in case you contract COVID, says Kasaro Barto, spokesperson for Squaremouth. Squaremouth recommends a minimum of $100,000 in emergency medical and medical evacuation coverage in order to account for COVID-19 related medical care and evacuation expenses. Sudden travel bans and unexpected quarantines requirements can also derail your trip, too, but standard travel insurance may not cover these problems, warns Barto. Buying cancel for any reason coverage will give you some reimbursement no matter what your reason for canceling. But add cancel for any reason coverage quickly if you want it, advises Barto. You may have only a couple weeks before the option expires for your plan. Also, some travel destinations abroad have medical coverage requirements for incoming travelers. Confirm the medical coverage requirements you’ll need for your destination before you buy a travel insurance plan. Other Plan Benefits to Look For The plans listed above include benefits beyond trip cancellation and medical coverage. Check out the details to make sure you’re getting other benefits you want, too. For example, the Cat 70 plan that scored among the highest in our rankings also provides reimbursement for: Trip cancellation due to injuries, weather, hurricanes and terrorism Travel delay Missed connections Baggage and personal items Methodology Using data provided by Squaremouth, Forbes Advisor scored plans based on these measurements: COVID medical coverage: 20 points. Plans earned points for providing medical coverage that does not exclude COVID. Type of medical coverage: 20 points. Plans earned points for having primary medical coverage vs. secondary coverage. Primary coverage is often preferred by travelers who don’t want to go through their own health plans first for a claim. Medical coverage limits: Up to 20 points. Plans earned more points for higher medical coverage amounts. COVID cancellation coverage: 40 points. Plans earned points for offering trip cancellation and interruption coverage if the traveler contracts COVID. Cancel for any reason coverage: 20 points. Plans earned points for also offering cancel for any reason coverage, which allows cancellation for any reason, including fear of traveling. It generally adds about 40% to the travel insurance cost. Related:  Compare &amp; Buy Travel Insurance For 2021 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) Will my health plan cover me if I get COVID while traveling abroad? U.S.-based health plans generally don’t offer coverage outside the U.S. That makes it even more important to have travel insurance with medical benefits. That way you’ll be covered for injuries and illness while on your trip. How much money can I get back with “cancel for any reason” coverage? Cancel for any reason coverage generally reimburses you 50% or 75% of your prepaid and nonrefundable trip expenses. The advantage of the coverage is that you aren’t limited to cancellation reasons defined by the policy. Will my pre-existing conditions be covered by travel insurance? Many travel insurance plans offer “pre-existing medical condition exclusion waivers.” These waivers mean that your existing medical conditions won’t be excluded from coverage. But note that these waivers must be added quickly after your initial trip deposit—usually within two or three weeks. &nbsp; See our rankings of the best travel insurance plans .
