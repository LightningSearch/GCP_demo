Netanel
Eliav
is
the
CEO
of
Sightbit
,
a
global
development
project
that
harnesses
advances
in
AI
and
image
recognition
technology
to
prevent
drowning
and
save
lives.
How
did
the
concept
for
Sightbit
originate?
Friends
Netanel
Eliav
and
Adam
Bismut
were
interested
in
using
tech
to
improve
the
world.
On
a
visit
to
the
beach,
their
mission
became
clear.
Adam
noticed
the
lack
of
tech
support
for
lifeguards,
who
monitored
hard-to-see
swimmers
with
binoculars.
The
system
uses
standard
cameras
that
cover
a
defined
area
and
transmits
that
information
in
real-time
to
lifeguards.
What
type
of
range
are
the
cameras
capable
of?
Also,
how
much
of
the
accuracy
becomes
reduced
with
greater
range?
Sightbit’s
innovation
is
in
the
software.
We
work
with
various
off-the-shelf
cameras
of
different
ranges,
customizing
camera
setup
to
meet
the
needs
of
each
customer
and
to
ensure
that
the
desired
area
is
protected.
At
Israel’s
Palmahim
Beach,
where
we
are
conducting
a
pilot,
we
built
a
dedicated
cement
platform
that
holds
three
cameras.
Each
camera
covers
300
meters
out
to
sea
in
normal
conditions,
the
range
required
at
Palmahim
Beach.
A
monitor
displays
a
panoramic
view
of
the
water
and
beach,
like
a
security
camera
display.
A
dashboard
is
superimposed
over
the
video
feed.
Sightbit
alerts
appear
as
flashing
boxes
around
individuals
and
hazards.
Multiple
views
from
different
camera
vantage
points
are
available
on
a
single
screen.
When
a
lifeguard
clicks
on
an
alert,
the
program
zooms
in,
allowing
the
lifeguard
to
see
the
swimmer
much
clear
than
is
possible
with
the
naked
eye. 
Four
additional
cameras
will
be
installed
shortly.
Can
you
discuss
some
of
the
computer
vision
challenges
behind
being
able
to
differentiate
between
a
human
swimming
and
a
human
struggling
to
stay
afloat?
We
can
detect
some
of
the
signs
of
distress
base
on
the
following:
Location
of
person
who
might
be
caught
in
a
rip
current,
located
far
from
shore
or
in
a
dangerous
area.
Movement/lack
of
movement
or
lack
of
movement.
Our
system
can
distinguish
swimmers
bobbing
up
and
down
in
the
water,
floating
face
down,
or
waving
for
help
as
signs
of
distress.
Sightbit
has
developed
software
that
incorporates
AI,
based
convolutional
neural
networks,
image
detection,
and
other
proprietary
algorithms
to
detect
swimmers
in
distress
and
avoid
false
positives.
What
are
the
risk
factors
for
false
positives
such
as
misidentifying
someone
as
drowning,
or
false
negatives
such
as
misidentifying
a
potential
drowning?
The
drowning
detection
feature
sometimes
generates
a
low-level
warning
when
a
swimmer
has
remained
underwater
for
long
stretches
of
time.
Like
lifeguards,
Sightbit
primarily
detects
swimmers
in
distress.
A
drowning
alert
is
an
alert
that
has
come
too
late.
We
focus
on
dangerous
situations
that
can
lead
to
drowning,
allowing
for
de-escalation
before
they
get
out
of
control.
For
example,
we
warn
when
swimmers
are
caught
in
rip
currents
so
that
lifeguards
or
other
rescue
personnel
can
reach
the
individual
in
time.
Our
real-time
alerts
include:
Swimmers
in
distress
Rip
currents
Children
alone
in
or
by
the
water
Water
vessels
entering
the
swim
area
Swimmers
entering
dangerous
areas.
This
may
be
choppy
water,
deep
water,
are
hazardous
areas
alongside
breakwater
structures
or
rocks.
Drowning
incidents
–
soon
to
be
deployed
at
Palmahim
And
other
situations
What
type
of
training
is
needed
to
use
the
Sightbit
system?
No
special
training
is
needed.
Sightbit’s
user
interface
takes
five
minutes
to
learn.
We
designed
the
system
with
lifeguards
to
ensure
that
it
is
easy
for
them
to
use
and
master.
Can
you
discuss
what
happens
in
the
backend
once
an
alert
is
triggered
for
a
potential
drowning?
The
beach
cameras
feed
into
a
GPU
for
video
analysis
and
a
CPU
for
analytics.
When
the
CPU
detects
a
threat,
it
generates
an
alert.
This
alert
is
customized
to
customer
needs.
At
Palmahim,
we
sound
alarms
and
generate
visual
alerts
on
the
screen.
Sightbit
can
also
be
configured
to
call
emergency
rescue.
Could
you
discuss
some
of
your
current
pilot
programs
and
the
types
of
results
that
have
been
achieved?
Sightbit
is
conducting
a
pilot
at
Palmahim
Beach
in
partnership
with
the
Israel
Nature
and
Parks
Authority.
The
system
is
installed
at
the
Palmahim
lifeguard
tower
and
is
in
use
by
lifeguards
(see
above
for
details
about
camera
placement,
warnings,
and
the
Sightbit
monitor).
The
pilot
went
live
at
the
end
of
May.
At
Palmahim,
three
lifeguards,
all
stationed
at
one
central
tower,
guard
the
one-kilometer
beach.
Sightbit
provides
instantaneous
alerts
when
swimmers
are
in
danger
and
camera
views
of
swimmers
far
from
the
tower.
Prior
to
the
pilot
partnership
at
Palmahim
Beach,
we
conducted
proof-of-concept
testing
at
beaches
throughout
Israel
at
the
invitation
of
local
authorities.
How
have
government
officials
reacted
so
far
when
introduced
to
the
technology?
Extreme
enthusiasm!
Cities
and
major
government-run
beaches
as
well
as
private
beaches
in
Israel,
the
United
States,
the
Balkans,
and
Scandinavia
have
invited
Sightbit
to
conduct
pilots.
We
have
been
granted
permissions
by
all
relevant
government
bodies.
Is
there
anything
else
that
you
would
like
to
share
about
Sightbit?
Yes!
We
are
currently
raising
funds
as
part
of
a
seed
round.
Investors
around
the
world
have
reached
out
to
us,
and
we
have
already
received
funding
offers.
We
previously
received
pre-seed
funding
from
the
Cactus
Capital
VC
fund
in
Israel.
&nbsp;
Long-Term
Potential:
People
are
not
optimized
for
tracking
dozens,
and
certainly
not
hundreds,
of
swimmers
from
a
watchtower.
Looking
long
term,
Sightbit
can
enable
agencies
to
guard
more
shoreline
at
lower
costs
by
using
Sightbit
systems
for
front-line
monitoring.
Lifeguards
can
be
assigned
to
headquarters
or
patrol
duty,
allowing
teams
to
respond
faster
to
incidents
anywhere
along
the
beach.
This
is
lifesaving.
Currently,
even
during
peak
summer
months,
lifeguards
monitor
less
than
half
of
the
shoreline
at
designated
public
swimming
beaches.
&nbsp;
Sightbit
can
safeguard
sites
24/7,
all
year
round.
Where
there
is
no
lifeguard
service,
Sightbit
alerts
emergency
dispatch
or
local
rescue
services
when
a
swimmer
is
in
danger
(for
example,
a
swimmer
swept
out
to
sea
in
a
rip
current).
Sightbit
software
can
also
pinpoint
and
track
a
swimmer’s
location
and
deliver
rescue
tubes
via
small
drones.
&nbsp;
Sightbit
can
bring
monitoring
to
many
different
aquatic
sites
that
do
not
currently
employ
lifeguards.
With
Sightbit,
aquatic
work
sites,
marinas,
reservoirs,
and
other
sites
can
benefit
from
water
safety
alerts.
Sightbit
also
provides
risk
analytics
and
management
insights,
which
allow
customers
to
anticipate
hazards
in
advance
and
improve
operations.
Customers
can
track
water
and
weather
conditions,
crowding,
and
more.
Thank
you
for
the
interview
regarding
this
important
project,
readers
who
wish
to
learn
more
should

Sightbit.
