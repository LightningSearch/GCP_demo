The
CA
Consumer
Privacy
Act
Went
into
Effect

You
Were

If
you&#8217;re
unfamiliar
with
the
California
Consumer
Privacy
Act
(CCPA),
you
might
want
to
stop
catching
up
on
email
you
missed
over
the
holiday
and
focus
on
this
new
regulation.
Here
are
a
few
highlights
of
California&#8217;s
new
law,
which
went
into
effect
yesterday.
CCPA
grants
California
residents
new
rights
when
it
comes
to
their
data
and
privacy.
Essentially,
this
group
of
consumers
are
now
entitled
to
know
what
data
businesses
collect
about
them,
where
they
received
it,
how
they
plan
to
use
it,
who
they
have
shared
it
with,
and
if
it
will
be
sold.
Here&#8217;s
are
some
take-aways
of
what
fintechs
need
to
know
now
that
the
new
rule
has
taken
hold:
What&#8217;s
required
of
you
Essentially,
California
consumers
have
the
right
to
receive
a
report
of
their
personal
information
that
a
business
has
collected
on
them
for
the
past
year,
the
right
to
have
that
data
deleted,
and
the
right
to
limit
the
sale
of
their
data
to
third
parties.
All
of
this
means
that
in
addition
to
tracking
consumer
data,
businesses
are
also
responsible
for
reporting
where
the
data
came
from
and
where
it&#8217;s
going.
CCPA
may
not
apply
to
you
The
state
of
California
has
almost
40
million
residents,
and
if
you&#8217;re
conducing
business
in
the
U.S.,
you
likely
have
clients
there.
And
even
if
you
don&#8217;t,
CCPA
grants
the
new
privacy
rights
to
all
California
residents
as
defined
by
income
tax,
even
if
they
are
not
currently
living
in
the
Sunshine
State.
In
contrast,
those
living
in
California
but
paying
income
tax
in
another
state
are
not
covered
by
CCPA.
That
said,
there&#8217;s
still
a
chance
CCPA
won&#8217;t
apply
to
you.
Businesses
with
gross
annual
revenues
less
than
$25
million,
or
those
that
deal
with
personal
information
of
fewer
than
50,000
consumers,
or
businesses
that
generate
less
than
50%
of
their
annual
revenue
from
selling
consumers&#8217;
personal
information
are
exempt.
Heads
up:
you
could
be
sued
Data
breaches
are
generally
always
costly,
and
CCPA
will
add
to
the
expense.
If
a
consumer
notifies
a
business
that
it
has
improperly
handled
their
data
and
the
business
doesn&#8217;t
rectify
the
issue
within
30
days,
the
consumer
has
a
right
to
sue
for
damages
in
the
amount
of
$100
to
$750
per
incident,
injunctive
or
declaratory
relief,
or
another
option
deemed
suitable
by
the
court.
On
top
of
that,
if
a
business
experiences
a
data
breach,
sells
consumer
data
without
permission,
or
retains
data
after
the
consumer
requested
it
to
be
deleted,
the
Attorney
General
has
a
right
to
charge
violators
$2500
to
$7500
for
each
consumer
data
file
involved.
CCPA
may
go
federal
As
you
plan
out
methodologies
to
document
data
collection,
usage,
and
distribution,
don&#8217;t
limit
your
systems
to
Californians.
The
privacy
act
may
eventually
be
escalated
to
the
federal
level
so
plan
your
data
protocol
around
all
of
your
U.S.
clients.
Just
because
you&#8217;re
GDPR
compliant
doesn&#8217;t
mean
you
comply
with
CCPA
The
U.K.&#8217;s
General
Data
Protection
Regulations
(GDPR)
went
into
effect
in
May
of
2018.
But
just
because
you&#8217;ve
mastered
your
compliance
strategy
for
GDPR
doesn&#8217;t
mean
you
can
rest
easy
when
it
comes
to
CCPA.
On
the
contrary,
there
are
a
handful
of
differences
between
the
two,
as
outlined
by
Pillsbury
Law:
The
coverage
group
The
privacy
policy
disclosures
The
breadth
of
disclosure
rights
The
data
disclosures
and
deadlines
The
right
to
opt-out
The
explicit
protection
against
discrimination
For
a
more
in-depth
look
into
the
differences,
I
highly
recommend
taking
a
look
at
Pillsbury
Law&#8217;s
piece.
Identity
verification
may
be
an
issue
A
user
may
request
access
to
all
of
his
data,
but
how
do
you
ensure
he
is
indeed
who
he
says
he
is
and
not
a
criminal?
Furthermore,
how
do
you
ensure
he
is
a
California
resident?
According
to
IDology
COO
Christina
Luttrell,
&#8220;If
GDPR
is
an
indicator
of
how
CCPA
will
unfold,
then
businesses
need
to
consider
how
criminals
can
and
will
exploit
subject
access
requests.&#8221;
Luttrell
went
on
to
explain,
&#8220;The
organizations
that
will
be
well
positioned
to
complete
CCPA-related
requests
are
the
ones
that
understand
the
facets
of
CCPA
identity
verification
(IDV)
and
adopt
IDV
systems
that
scale
and
automate,
are
secure
and
easily
integrated,
and
have
multiple
IDV
methods
that
will
satisfy
consumer
needs.&#8221;
You
may
be
late
but
you&#8217;re
not
too
late
In
the
event
a
business
violates
the
CCPA,
it
has
additional
time
before
fines
and
enforcement
take
hold
due
to
the
30
day
period
to
cure
noncompliance.
If
a
business
can
fix
a
problem
with
its
privacy
compliance
and
follow
the
procedures
set
forth
in
the
law
to
do
so,
then
they
haven&#8217;t
violated
the
law
and
will
not
be
subject
to
a
lawsuit
for
the
failure
to
comply.
