Zayd
Enam
is
the
Co-founder
and
CEO
of
Cresta,
a
company
founded
with
the
goal
of
using
AI
to
transform
how
users
learn
high-value
skills.
Cresta
brings
together
industry-leading
AI
experts,
decades
of
contact
center
and
sales
expertise,
proven
leadership,
and
top-tier
investors
including
Andreessen
Horowitz
and
Greylock
Partners.
What
initially
attracted
you
to
AI? 
I
started
working
in
AI
because
I
was
really
fascinated
by
the
brain
and
how
it
works.
At
Berkeley,
I
started
working
at
the
Redwood
Center
for
Theoretical
Neuroscience.
The
goal
was
to
model
the
brain
in
software
to
understand
why
it
became
the
way
it
was
—
in
other
words,
how
the
evolution
of
the
brain
happened.
Because
of
all
of
that,
I
was
fascinated
by
the
use
of
AI
and
ML
to
model
the
brain.
The
brain
is
such
a
complex
system,
though,
that
I
realized
that
the
tools
that
we
were
using
had
immediate
applications.
That’s
how
I
started
working
with
Sebastian
Thrun,
professor
at
Stanford
University
and
the
head
of
the
Stanford
Artificial
Intelligence
Lab
as
well
as
the
co-founder
and
chairman
of
Udacity.
Because
Sebastian
was
doing
really
interesting
things
with
AI,
I
wanted
to
work
with
him,
taking
my
interest
in
neuroscience,
combining
it
with
AI/ML,
and
seeing
where
it
led
us.
How
did
initially
come
across
the
concept
for
Cresta?
In
my
work
with
Sebastian
Thrun,
we
started
by
building
a
platform
that
helped
computer
science
teaching
assistants
and
graders
give
consistently
good
feedback
to
students,
because
we
noticed
that
there
was
a
huge
gap
in
the
quality
of
feedback.
This
was
something
we
were
particularly
familiar
with
at
the
lab,
so
we
focused
on
building
a
system
that
learned
from
students
and
TAs
year-over-year
with
a
focus
on
identifying
common
mistakes
and
what
feedback
produced
better
results.
Ultimately,
we
were
able
to
double
the
speed
of
the
graders.
However,
the
market
itself
wasn’t
very
large,
and
we
realized
that
we
wanted
to
take
the
idea
and
expand
it
across
all
knowledge
work.
Sebastian
then
gave
me
a
piece
of
advice
that
has
stuck
with
me
ever
since:
go
to
the
desert.
In
his
work
with
driverless
and
flying
cars,
he
went
out
to
the
desert
in
order
to
test
and
build
a
system
that
actually
worked,
then
came
back
to
the
lab
and
studied
the
science,
which
ended
up
being
a
better
approach
because
it
was
real-world
tested.
Cresta’s
desert
involved
going
to
companies
and
observing
how
people
were
working,
what
they
were
doing,
and
beginning
to
build
small
tools
to
automate
work.
An
early
project
in
support
was
about
to
be
canceled,
but
I
asked
if
we
could
pivot
to
sales
and
show
top-line
revenue.
Between
myself
and
two
converted
agents,
we
proved
$100,000
of
incremental
revenue
per
month.
With
that,
I
realized
we
had
a
tool
on
our
hands
that
could
really
help
people
and
have
a
positive
impact
on
the
world.
You
dropped
out
of
a
PhD
program
at
Stanford
to
focus
on
launching
Cresta,
how
difficult
of
a
decision
was
this
for
you?
It
was
difficult,
to
be
sure,
but
for
me,
I
knew
that
if
I
was
in
the
lab,
I
would
be
stuck
and
unable
to
have
the
real
impact
I
was
looking
for.
In
that
respect,
it
was
natural
for
me
to
drop
out.
I
started
the
PhD
program
because
I
wanted
to
build
something
that
made
a
difference
in 
the
future,
but
I
ended
up
building
something
that
is
making
a
difference
now
&#8211;
we
are
using
AI
to
save
jobs,
not
reduce
jobs.
How
would
you
best
describe
how
Cresta
uses
AI
to
train
human
customer
service
agents?
Cresta
identifies
the
top
agent
behaviors
that
lead
to
successful
customer
outcomes,
such
as
maintaining
conversation
flow,
identifying
successful
troubleshooting
steps
and
setting
expectations,
and
then
re-distributes
these
learnings
to
every
agent
in
real-time
through
use
of
deep
reinforcement
learning
in
particular.
Cresta’s
software
is
always
learning
from
best
results,
enabling
agents
to
quickly
adapt
to
changing
customer
and
business
needs,
effectively
turning
every
agent
into
an
immediate
expert.
Outside
of
coaching
customer
service
agents,
Cresta
is
also
able
to
automate
some
repetitive
tasks.
Could
you
share
with
us
what
some
of
these
are?
We
automate
lead
and
ticket
creation
for
agents.
In
addition,
we
automate
order
entries
and
account
validation.
These
tools
help
improve
efficiency
and
help
save
agents
time
that
they
can
then
use
to
help
other
customers.
How
much
of
a
difference
in
conversions
and
the
bottom
line
have
enterprises
seen
by
using
Cresta?
For
a
top-5
SaaS
that
we
count
among
our
customers,
we’ve
quadrupled
revenue
per
agent
and
doubled
conversion
rate
and
chat
volume.
Cox
Communications
has
seen
a
12%
increase
in
revenue
since
using
Cresta.
In
addition,
a
leading
retailer
saw
a
25%
increase
in
revenue
per
chat.
For
an
enterprise
client
that
is
ready
to
sign
up,
how
much
time
is
needed
to
integrate
Cresta?
We
can
actually
integrate
Cresta
into
extant
systems
within
minutes,
and
our
AI
goes
to
work
immediately.
On
average,
it
takes
about
4-6
weeks
to
start
seeing
results.
Is
there
anything
else
that
you
would
like
to
share
about
Cresta?
Cresta
avoids
what
I
call
a
“lazy”
approach
to
AI
—
automating
everything
a
human
is
doing.
Instead,
I
think
some
of
the
biggest
advances
come
from
combining
what
a
human
and
machine
can
do
to
achieve
things
that
neither
could
do
apart.
Does
this
require
more
energy
and
creativity?
Absolutely.
But
I
think
it’s
worth
it
in
the
end.
