Conversational
AI
will
improve
applications
in
many
fields
including&nbsp;retail,
customer
service,
automotive
and
banking.&nbsp;
NVIDIA
today
announced
breakthroughs
in
language
understanding
that
allow
businesses
to
engage
more
naturally
with
customers
using
real-time
conversational
AI.
NVIDIA&#39;s
AI
platform
is
the
first
to
train
one
of
the
most
advanced
AI
language
models
&mdash;
&nbsp;BERT
&mdash;
&nbsp;in
less
than
an
hour
and
complete
AI
inference
in
just
over
2
milliseconds.
This
groundbreaking
level
of
performance
makes
it
possible
for
developers
to
use
state-of-the-art
language
understanding
for
large-scale
applications
they
can
make
available
to
hundreds
of
millions
of
consumers
worldwide.
Early
adopters
of
NVIDIA&#39;s
performance
advances
include
Microsoft
and
some
of
the
world&#39;s
most
innovative
startups,
which
are
harnessing
NVIDIA&#39;s
platform
to
develop
highly
intuitive,
immediately
responsive
language-based
services
for
their
customers.&nbsp;
Limited
conversational
AI
services
have
existed
for
several
years.
But
until
this
point,
it
has
been
extremely
difficult
for
chatbots,
intelligent
personal
assistants
and
search
engines
to
operate
with
human-level
comprehension
due
to
the
inability
to
deploy
extremely
large
AI
models
in
real
time.
NVIDIA
has
addressed
this
problem
by
adding
key
optimizations
to
its
AI
platform
&mdash;
&nbsp;achieving
speed
records
in
AI
training
and
inference
and
building
the
largest
language
model
of
its
kind
to
date.
&quot;Large
language
models
are
revolutionizing
AI
for
natural
language,&quot;
said
Bryan
Catanzaro,
vice
president
of
Applied
Deep
Learning
Research
at
NVIDIA.
&quot;They
are
helping
us
solve
exceptionally
difficult
language
problems,
bringing
us
closer
to
the
goal
of
truly
conversational
AI.
NVIDIA&#39;s
groundbreaking
work
accelerating
these
models
allows
organizations
to
create
new,
state-of-the-art
services
that
can
assist
and
delight
their
customers
in
ways
never
before
imagined.&quot;
Fastest
Training,
Fastest
Inference,
Largest
Model
AI
services
powered
by
natural
language
understanding
are
expected
to
grow
exponentially
in
the
coming
years.
Digital
voice
assistants
alone
are
anticipated
to
climb
from
2.5
billion
to
8
billion
within
the
next
four
years,
according
to
Juniper
Research
.
Additionally,
Gartner
predicts,
by
2021,
15%
of
all
customer
service
interactions
will
be
completely
handled
by
AI,
an
increase
of
400%
from
2017.

Helping
lead
this
new
era,
NVIDIA
has
fine-tuned
its
AI
platform
with
key
optimizations
that
have
resulted
in
three
new
natural
language
understanding
performance
records:
Fastest
training:
Running
the
large
version
of
one
of
the
world&#39;s
most
advanced
AI
language
models&nbsp;
&mdash;
&nbsp;Bidirectional
Encoder
Representations
from
Transformers
(BERT)
&mdash;
&nbsp;an
NVIDIA
DGX
SuperPOD&trade;
using
92
NVIDIA
DGX-2H&trade;
systems
running
1,472
NVIDIA
V100
GPUs
slashed
the
typical
training
time
for
BERT-Large
from
several
days
to
just
53
minutes.
Additionally,
NVIDIA
trained
BERT-Large
on
just
one
NVIDIA
DGX-2
system
in
2.8
days
-
demonstrating
NVIDIA
GPUs&#39;
scalability
for
conversational
AI.
Fastest
inference:
Using
NVIDIA
T4
GPUs
running
NVIDIA
TensorRT&trade;,
NVIDIA
performed
inference
on
the
BERT-Base
SQuAD
dataset
in
only
2.2
milliseconds
-
well
under
the
10-millisecond
processing
threshold
for
many
real-time
applications,
and
a
sharp
improvement
from
over
40
milliseconds
measured
with
highly
optimized
CPU
code.
Largest
model:
With
a
focus
on
developers&#39;
ever-increasing
need
for
larger
models,
NVIDIA
Research
built
and
trained
the
world&#39;s
largest
language
model
based
on
Transformers,
the
technology
building
block
used
for
BERT
and
a
growing
number
of
other
natural
language
AI
models.
NVIDIA&#39;s
custom
model,
with
8.3
billion
parameters,
is
24
times
the
size
of
BERT-Large.
Ecosystem
Adoption
Hundreds
of
developers
worldwide
are
already
using
NVIDIA&#39;s
AI
platform
to
advance
their
own
language
understanding
research
and
create
new
services.
Microsoft
Bing
is
using
the
power
of
its
Azure
AI
platform
and
NVIDIA
technology
to
run
BERT
and
drive
more
accurate
search
results.
&quot;Microsoft
Bing
relies
on
the
most
advanced
AI
models
and
computing
platform
to
deliver
the
best
global
search
experience
possible
for
our
customers,&quot;
said
Rangan
Majumder,
group
program
manager,
Microsoft
Bing.
&quot;In
close
collaboration
with
NVIDIA,
Bing
further
optimized
the
inferencing
of
the
popular
natural
language
model
BERT
using
NVIDIA
GPUs,
part
of
Azure
AI
infrastructure,
which
led
to
the
largest
improvement
in
ranking
search
quality
Bing
deployed
in
the
last
year.
We
achieved
two
times
the
latency
reduction
and
five
times
throughput
improvement
during
inference
using
Azure
NVIDIA
GPUs
compared
with
a
CPU-based
platform,
enabling
Bing
to
offer
a
more
relevant,
cost-effective,
real-time
search
experience
for
all
our
customers
globally.&quot;
Several
startups
in
NVIDIA&#39;s
Inception
program
,
including
Clinc,
Passage
AI
and
Recordsure,
are
also
using
NVIDIA&#39;s
AI
platform
to
build
cutting-edge
conversational
AI
services
for
banks,
car
manufacturers,
retailers,
healthcare
providers,
travel
and
hospitality
companies,
and
more.
Clinc
has
made
NVIDIA
GPU-enabled
conversational
AI
solutions
accessible
to
more
than
30
million
people
globally
through
a
customer
roster
that
includes
leading
car
manufacturers,
healthcare
organizations
and
some
of
the
world&#39;s
leading
financial
institutions,
including
Barclays,
USAA
and
Turkey&#39;s
largest
bank,
Isbank.&nbsp;
&quot;Clinc&#39;s
leading
AI
platform
understands
complex
questions
and
transforms
them
into
powerful,
actionable
insights
for
the
world&#39;s
leading
brands,&quot;
said
Jason
Mars,
CEO
of
Clinc.
&quot;The
breakthrough
performance
that
NVIDIA&#39;s
AI
platform
provides
has
allowed
us
to
push
the
boundaries
of
conversational
AI
and
deliver
revolutionary
services
that
help
our
customers
use
technology
to
engage
with
their
customers
in
powerful,
more
meaningful
ways.&quot;
