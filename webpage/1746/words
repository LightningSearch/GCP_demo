A
great
deal
of
the
work
that
people
do
every
day
doesn’t
involve
any
of
their
creativity
or
unique
skills,
being
highly
tedious
and
simple
tasks
like
categorizing
emails
and
messages,
updating
spreadsheets,
processing
transactions,
and
more.
Robotic
Process
Automation
(RPA)
is
an
emerging
technology
that
often
leverages
aspects
of
artificial
intelligence
to
automate
these
tasks,
with
the
goal
of
enabling
workers
to
devote
their
attention
to
more
important
tasks.
RPA
can
be
accomplished
with
a
variety
of
different
techniques,
tools,
and
algorithms,
and
the
corrected
applications
of
RPA
can
bring
organizations
many
benefits.
What
is
Robotic
Process
Automation
(RPA)?
Despite
having
the
name
“robot”
in
it,
Robotic
Process
Automation
has
nothing
to
do
with
physical
robots.
Rather,
the
robots
referred
to
in
RPA
are
software
bots,
and
RPA
systems
are
essentially
just
a
collection
of
bots
that
carry
out
specific,
often
tedious
tasks.
RPA
bots
can
run
on
either
physical
or
virtual
machines,
and
they
can
be
directed
to
carry
out
tasks
by
the
software’s
user.
RPA
interfaces
are
intended
to
allow
even
people
unfamiliar
with
the
construction
of
the
bots
to
define
a
set
of
tasks
for
the
bot
to
perform.
As
previously
mentioned,
the
main
purpose
of
an
RPA
is
to
automate
the
many
repetitive,
mundane
tasks
that
people
often
have
to
do
in
a
workplace.
Saving
time
and
resources
is
the
goal
of
RPA.
The
tasks
that
RPA
is
used
to
carry
out
need
to
be
fairly
simple,
with
a
concrete
series
of
steps
to
follow
to
accomplish
this
task.
Benefits
of
Robotic
Process
Automation
(RPA)
When
properly
utilized,
RPA
technology
can
free
up
timer,
personnel,
and
resources,
letting
them
be
applied
to
more
important
tasks
and
challenges.
RPA
can
be
used
to
enable
better
customer
service
by
handling
the
first
interactions
with
customers
and
directing
them
to
the
right
customer
service
agent.
RPA
systems
can
also
be
used
to
improve
how
data
is
collected
and
handled.
For
instance,
when
transactions
occur
they
can
be
digitized
and
automatically
entered
into
a
database.
RPA
systems
can
also
be
used
to
ensure
that
the
operations
of
a
business
comply
with
established
standards
and
regulations.
RPA
can
also
meaningfully
reduce
human
error
rates
and
log
actions
taken
so
that
if
there
if
the
system
does
produce
an
error,
the
events
that
led
to
the
error
can
easily
be
identified.
Ultimately,
the
benefits
of
RPA
apply
to
any
situation
where
a
process
can
be
made
more
efficient
by
automating
many
of
the
steps
needed
to
complete
that
process.
How
Robotic
Process
Automation
(RPA)
Works
The
exact
methods
RPA
platforms
and
bots
use
to
carry
out
their
task
vary,
but
they
often
employ
some
machine
learning
and
AI
algorithms,
as
well
as
computer
vision
algorithms.
Machine
learning
and
AI
techniques
may
be
employed
to
let
the
bots
learn
which
actions
are
correlated
with
the
goals
the
operator
has
defined.
However,
RPA
platforms
often
carry
out
most
of
their
actions
according
to
rules,
therefore
acting
more
like
traditional
programs
than
AI.
As
a
result,
there
is
some
debate
regarding
whether
or
not
RPA
systems
should
be
classified
as
AI
systems.
Even
so,
RPA
often
works
in
concert
with
AI
technologies
and
algorithms.
Deep
neural
networks
can
be
used
to
interpret
complex
image
and
text
data,
enabling
the
bots
to
determine
what
actions
need
to
be
carried
out
to
handle
this
data
in
the
manner
the
user
has
specified,
even
if
the
actions
the
bot
takes
is
strictly
rules-based.
For
instance,
convolutional
neural
networks
can
be
used
to
allow
a
network
to
interpret
images
on
a
screen
and
react
based
upon
how
those
images
are
classified.
What
Processes
Can
Be
Handled
By
RPA?
Examples
of
tasks
that
can
be
handled
by
RPA
systems
include
basic
data
manipulation,
transaction
processing,
and
communicating
with
other
digital
systems.
A
RPA
system
could
be
set
up
to
collect
data
from
specific
sources
or
clean
data
that
has
been
received.
In
general,
there
are
four
criteria
that
a
task
must
fulfill
to
be
a
good
candidate
for
automation
with
RPA.
First,
the
process
must
be
rule-based
,
with
very
specific
instructions
and
ground
facts
that
can
be
used
to
determine
what
to
do
with
the
information
the
system
encounters.
Secondly,
the
process
should
occur
at
specific
times
or
have
a
definable
start
condition.
Thirdly,
the
process
should
have
clear
inputs
and
outputs.
Finally,
the
task
should
have
volume,
it
should
deal
with
a
sizable
amount
of
information
and
require
a
fair
amount
of
time
to
complete
so
that
it
would
make
sense
to
automate
the
process.
Based
on
these
principles,
let’s
examine
some
potential
use
cases
for
RPA.
One
way
that
RPA
could
be
used
is
to
expedite
the
process
of
handling
customer
returns.
Returns
are
typically
a
costly,
time-intensive
endeavor.
When
a
return
is
requested,
the
customer
service
agent
has
to
send
a
number
of
messages
that
confirm
the
return
and
how
the
customer
would
like
their
money
refunded,
update
current
inventory
in
the
system,
and
then
after
making
the
payment
to
the
customer
update
the
sales
figures.
Much
of
this
could
be
handled
by
an
RPA
that
ascertains
which
items
are
being
returned
and
how
the
customer
wants
their
refund
dispersed.
The
RPA
would
just
use
rules
that
take
as
an
input
the
product
being
returned
and
the
customer’s
information
and
output
a
complete
refund
document
that
the
agent
would
just
have
to
glance
at
and
approve.
Another
potential
use
case
for
RPA
is
for
retailers
who
would
like
to
automate
aspects
of
their
supply
chain
management.
RPA
could
be
used
to
keep
items
in
stock,
checking
inventory
levels
whenever
an
item
is
sold
and
when
the
stock
falls
below
a
certain
threshold
orders
for
replacements
can
be
made.
Drawbacks
To
Robotic
Process
Automation
(RPA)
While
RPA
systems
have
the
potential
to
save
companies
who
use
them
time,
money,
and
effort,
they
are
not
suited
to
every
task.
RPA
implementations
may
often
fail
due
to
the
constraints
of
the
system
they
operate
in.
If
not
properly
designed
and
implemented,
RPA
systems
can
also
exacerbate
currently
existing
problems
as
they
operate
on
rules
that
may
cease
to
be
applicable
as
situations
evolve.
For
example,
if
an
RPA
system
is
instructed
to
order
replacements
of
items
whenever
a
stock
falls
too
low,
it
may
not
be
able
to
adjust
to
fluctuations
in
demand
and
continue
ordering
large
batches
of
products
even
as
the
overall
demand
for
those
products
declines.
Scaling
RPA
platforms
up
across
a
company
also
proves
to
be
difficult,
as
the
more
rules-based
a
system-becomes
the
more
inflexible
it
becomes.
Additionally,
the
act
of
installing
thousands
of
bots
across
a
system
might
be
much
more
time-intensive
and
costly
than
expected,
potentially
costly
enough
that
the
savings
the
RPA
system
brings
don’t
offset
the
costs
of
installation.
The
economic
impacts
of
RPA
systems
can
be
difficult
to
predict
and
the
relationship
between
automation
and
cost
reduction
is
not
a
linear
one.
Automating
30%
of
a
task
will
not
necessarily
reduce
a
company’s
costs
by
30%.
