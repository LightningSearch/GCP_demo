this

Passed

What
Would
A
City
Look
Like
If
It
Were
Designed
Entirely
By
And
For
Women?
These
Places
Offer
A
Glimpse.
The
geography
of
a
city
has
a
huge
impact
on
the
people
who
live
and
work
there,
but
too
often,
urban
spaces
don’t
allow
women
to
feel
safe,
welcome,
and
empowered.
If
we
want
gender
equality,
we
must
seize
the
opportunity
to
reimagine
our
urban
spaces—with
women
at
the
forefront.

The

The
Ball
In
The
Wrong
Court
In
courts
of
law,
the
NCAA
has
launched
a
full-court
press
to
deny
college
athletes’
basic
rights
to
a
real
education,
to
their
own
images
and
likenesses,
and
to
their
health
and
safety.
And
the
cost
is
exorbitant.
