İşbank
&#8211;
Turkey’s
largest
private
bank
&#8211;
and
their
virtual
assistant
Maxi
were
recently
highlighted
in
a
story
on
American
Banker
.
The
article
took
a
deep
dive
into
Maxi
and
the
bank’s
ability
to
quickly
deploy
new
competencies
for
their
customers,
using
Clinc’s
technology,
during
the
COVID-19
pandemic.
“&#8230;after
the
novel
coronavirus
spread
to
Turkey
in
March,
Maxi
started
helping
customers
navigate
their
loan
deferrals
and
learn
about
precautions
the
bank
was
taking.
The
conversations
between
Maxi
and
İşbank’s
customers,
which
take
place
over
İşbank’s
IsCep
and
Maximum
Mobil
mobile
apps
or
on
WhatsApp,
jumped
70%,
from
1.8
million
in
February
to
3
million
in
April.”
İşbank’s
success
is
a
textbook
example
of
well
implemented
conversational
AI
technology.&nbsp;
As
the
article
points
out,
the
bank
was
able
to
move
quickly
during
a
crisis
because
they
had
dedicated
the
time
and
resources
to
training
Maxi
when
it
was
first
deploy
in
2018
&#8211;
a
lesson
for
banks
who
have
been
slow
to
adopt
new
technology
until
now.
“The
same
strategies
&#8211;
painstakingly
collecting
data
from
real
people,
quickly
analyzing
new
customer
concerns
as
they
come
up,
and
uniting
data
science,
design
and
product
employees
into
one
dedicated
conversational
artificial
intelligence
team
&#8211;
can
be
replicated
at
U.S.
banks
as
well.
To
date,
virtual
assistants
are
scarce
in
U.S.
banks
as
they
try
to
figure
out
how
to
make
them
work
flawlessly
and
usefully.
But
all
banks
are
trying
to
find
the
right
tools
to
interact
with
customers
at
a
time
when
person-to-person
interactions
are
still
not
possible
in
most
states.”
By
using
Clinc’s
technology
İşbank
has
created
a
digital
banking
experience
that
closely
mimics
the
person-to-person
interaction
expected
when
visiting
a
local
branch.&nbsp;
As
the
article
highlights,
the
crux
of
Clinc’s
product
is
the
ability
to
analyze
speech
patterns,
word
structure
and
sentiment,
so
virtual
assistants
created
by
Clinc
can
understand
and
respond
to
everyday
human
speech
&#8211;
no
matter
how
informal
the
question
is,
or
if
it’s
phrased
indirectly.
“The
goal
was
to
make
conversations
with
Maxi
as
natural
as
possible,
rather
than
sending
users
through
a
decision
tree
of
options.&nbsp;
İşbank
also
personalized
its
virtual
assistant
by
integrating
customer
data
so
Maxi
can
interpret
more
specific
questions
and
deliver
insights
into
spending.”
To
date,
5.7
million
of
İşbank’s
8.2
million
mobile
banking
customers
have
used
Maxi.
